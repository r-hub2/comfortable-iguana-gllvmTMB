## `gllvmTMBcontrol(va_H = , va_eval_method = )` — the VA route's two knobs.
##
## Both were previously UNREACHABLE: `R/va-routing.R` hard-wired the tier and the
## engine's H default, so a caller could select `integration = "va"` and then not
## choose how it evaluates. Gate E subsequently promoted public `auto` to GH
## with H = 7; explicit JJ remains a binomial-logit comparison tier.
##
## The load-bearing property of this exposure is that it changes NOTHING by
## default. Every test below that asserts a default is guarding against a silent
## behaviour change for existing callers, which is the real risk of adding a knob
## to a router.
