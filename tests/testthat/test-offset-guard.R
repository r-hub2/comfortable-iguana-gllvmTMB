## `offset()` in a top-level formula must not be silently ignored.
##
## The lv sub-formula has rejected offsets since R/lv-predictor.R:156 ("Offset
## handling for latent-score means has not been derived"), and the design docs
## list offsets among the terms that still reject. The top-level fixed-effect
## formula never received the equivalent guard, so `offset(x)` was accepted and
## then dropped by model.matrix() -- the user got a different model from the one
## they wrote, with no error and no warning. Measured before the fix: logLik
## identical with and without a *varying* offset, difference exactly 0.
##
## Offsets are now SUPPORTED for count families (#833; see
## test-offset-support.R). These fixtures are all gaussian, so they still
## reject -- but on the family gate rather than a blanket refusal, and the
## message changed accordingly. What must not change is that a gaussian fit
## never silently accepts a varying offset.
##
## These tests are deliberately cheap and un-gated: the failure they guard is
## silent, so it must be caught on an ordinary run.
