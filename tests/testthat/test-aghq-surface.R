## Surface-level tests for the AGHQ (adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature)
## engine: the control-surface contract, the family-agnostic quadrature
## kernel's exactness/movement behaviour, the anti-runaway adaptation cap,
## and the honesty of the structural fence.
##
## These are DIFFERENT tests from tests/testthat/test-aghq-golden.R (a
## peer-owned file): the golden file proves quadrature ACCURACY against an
## independent brute-force oracle; this file proves the USER-FACING
## SURFACE behaves as documented and does not silently misbehave (runaway,
## silent fallback, invalid control values slipping through unvalidated).
##
## Every fit below is deterministic (fixed seed, n_init = 1, init_jitter =
## 0), so the hard-coded reference numbers are exact reproductions of a
## real run of this code, not invented figures. Re-derive them with
## devtools::load_all() + the fixture helpers below if the AGHQ engine
## changes in a way that legitimately moves these numbers.
##
## Peers are actively editing src/gllvmTMB.cpp and R/fit-multi.R while this
## file is written, so every fit-dependent test skip_if_not()s on an actual
## smoke fit (not an exists()/formals() probe) rather than failing outright
## if the kernel is momentarily incomplete.
