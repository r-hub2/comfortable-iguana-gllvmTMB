## The Gate-1 fixture must be reachable from an INSTALLED package, and the
## shipped copy must not drift from the source-of-truth copy.
##
## Background: `docs/` is excluded from the build (.Rbuildignore), so
## `.eva_gate1_file()`'s upward directory walk only succeeded inside a source
## checkout. Under `R CMD check` the tests run from a temp directory against the
## installed package, the walk reached the filesystem root, and the gate tests
## failed -- the check's only ERROR. `devtools::load_all()` never reproduced it.
##
## The fix ships a copy in inst/extdata/. That creates a new hazard: two copies
## that can silently diverge. These tests exist to make both failures loud.
