## E3 golden tests for the AGHQ engine (Arc 0). See
## tests/testthat/helper-aghq-golden.R for the independent brute-force
## oracle and the ladder harness.
##
## Three golden tests, deliberately kept apart because they prove different
## (and often-conflated) things:
##
##   GOLDEN 1 is a PLUMBING test: k = 1 is mathematically identical to the
##   Laplace approximation, so agreement there says nothing about whether
##   AGHQ integrates accurately at k > 1. This project's earlier O3 spike
##   reported a 1.4e-9 k=1 agreement that was later cited as evidence "AGHQ
##   works" -- it wasn't; it was this same plumbing fact. Do not cite GOLDEN
##   1 as evidence of quadrature accuracy.
##
##   GOLDEN 2 is the real accuracy test: it compares the package's AGHQ
##   objective, AT A FIXED PARAMETER POINT, against a marginal likelihood
##   computed completely independently (stats::integrate() on the model's
##   own definition, not via any AGHQ helper or the TMB template). Fixed
##   point, not a fresh fitted optimum per k, so there is no outer-optimiser
##   convergence flag to fail on -- see the test's own comment and
##   helper-aghq-golden.R's "WHY A FIXED POINT" note for why.
##
##   GOLDEN 3 is a null-control test on poisson data: unlike gaussian
##   exactness (test-aghq-surface.R), a poisson integrand is genuinely
##   non-gaussian, so a fully-active AGHQ (aghq$used == TRUE, not gated back
##   to Laplace) agreeing with Laplace there is real evidence the quadrature
##   is doing correct work, not a structural inability to disagree.
##
## All three skip_if_not() when the AGHQ kernel is not available for that
## specific fixture (checked by an actual smoke fit, not just an
## argument-name probe), so this file is green rather than red if the
## kernel is ever gated off for a fixture it does not (yet) cover.

## ============================================================================
## HISTORY (2026-07-28, resolved). GOLDEN 2 was left DELIBERATELY RED for one
## slice after the smoke gate above was fixed to probe k = 3: it fitted a
## fresh model at each k and asserted `all(ladder$convergence == 0L)`, which
## failed because the outer optimiser stalls on the n_site = 3, T = 2
## fixture ("no honest descent at cap 1 after backtracking") even though the
## error against the oracle WAS falling with k (0.298 -> 0.267 -> 0.181 at
## k = 7/9/15) -- i.e. the test was measuring the optimiser, not the
## integral. Fixed by the test-design change described in GOLDEN 2's own
## comment above: evaluate the AGHQ objective at ONE fixed parameter point
## (no optimiser in the loop, so no convergence flag to fail on) on a
## well-identified fixture, and compare to the independent oracle at that
## same point. See helper-aghq-golden.R's "WHY A FIXED POINT" comment for
## the mechanism and dev/aghq-evidence/02-template-vs-oracle.R for the
## precedent this mirrors.

## ============================================================================
## GOLDEN 3 [null control, poisson]: stronger evidence than gaussian exactness.
## ============================================================================
##
## GAUSSIAN EXACTNESS (test-aghq-surface.R) has a structural blind spot: after
## the adaptive transform, a gaussian integrand IS the GH kernel, so ANY
## correctly-normalised quadrature rule reproduces it exactly at every k --
## including a rule with badly placed nodes. It cannot detect a node-placement
## bug. Poisson (log link) has no such degeneracy: the per-site integral is
## genuinely non-gaussian and the quadrature has real work to do.
##
## And yet a 7550-fit campaign (2026-07-28, dev/aghq-evidence/) found Laplace
## is ALREADY essentially exact for poisson too: median ||Lambda_hat||/
## ||Lambda|| = 1.006 / 1.006 / 0.995 / 0.997 at T = 2/4/6/12, and AGHQ k = 9
## -- FULLY ACTIVE (aghq$used == TRUE on 100% of those fits) -- correctly
## changes it by only +0.006 / -0.002 / 0.000 / 0.000. This test is the
## CI-cheap version of that null control: a genuinely active quadrature
## (not a stub, not gated back to Laplace) must still find essentially
## nothing to correct. That is real power gaussian exactness cannot offer,
## because here AGHQ is doing non-trivial work and is asserted to (correctly)
## agree with Laplace anyway, rather than being unable to disagree at all.
##
## POISSON REQUIRES unique = FALSE. AGHQ Stage 1a is loadings-only: the
## template hard-errors on s_B ("use_aghq Stage 1a is loadings-only (no
## s_B)", src/gllvmTMB.cpp:2480) whenever use_diag_B == 1, i.e. whenever the
## default Psi (unique = TRUE) is active. Single-trial Bernoulli and
## multinomial fits escape this only because auto_psi_B (R/fit-multi.R,
## ~4683) pins Psi off automatically for those two families specifically;
## poisson has no such carve-out, so an AGHQ poisson fit must ask for
## unique = FALSE explicitly, as the formula below does.
