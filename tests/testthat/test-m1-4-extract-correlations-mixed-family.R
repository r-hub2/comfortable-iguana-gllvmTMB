## M1.4 — extract_correlations() mixed-family validation.
##
## Exercises the admitted Fisher-z / Wald / bootstrap routes and the explicit
## refusal of the withdrawn nonlinear profile route against the M1.2 fixtures.
##
## Scope: shape + bracketing + range, not numerical-depth (R = 200
## empirical coverage is M3.3 work).
##
## Bootstrap is slow, so it runs on one fixture. Fisher-z + Wald
## (closed-form) run on both fixtures; profile requests fail before refitting.

# §8): the bootstrap path in extract_correlations doesn't fully
# propagate `link_residual = "auto"` through bootstrap_Sigma. The
# bracket check therefore allows wider tolerance than the closed-
# form methods. The fix is M1.8 scope (bootstrap_Sigma mixed-family).

# single-pair `pair =` dispatch. We assert schema, row count, method
# label, and the [-1, 1] point-range invariant only.
#
# We deliberately do NOT add the full bracket check
# (lower <= correlation <= upper). The bootstrap path does not fully
# propagate `link_residual = "auto"` through bootstrap_Sigma — the arg
# exists (R/bootstrap-sigma.R:166) but propagation is incomplete, so the
# bootstrap CI can be over-wide / mis-centred. The fix is M1.8 scope
# (bootstrap_Sigma mixed-family); bracket calibration is CI-10 /
# Design-50 / M3.3b gated. These cells are shape evidence, not an
# interval-calibration claim, and must not be read as "fixing" the gap.
