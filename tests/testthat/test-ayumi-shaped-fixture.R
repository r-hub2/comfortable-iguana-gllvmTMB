## #25: the "Ayumi-shaped" standing fixture.
##
## WHY this exists: every fixture in this suite up to #25 was either small
## (n ~ 30, p ~ 3-4) or unridged (default `aghq_ridge` left at Inf in most
## hand-built test fixtures, even though the package default is 2). Ayumi's
## real corpus fits single-trial Bernoulli GLLVMs with 44-71 traits and the
## ridge ON by default -- a configuration none of our goldens exercised. The
## first user running ridge-on at that scale found in days (#1092's
## penalised-gradient misread of `converged`; #25's B1 boundary-flag false
## positive; B2's missing `fitted()` method) what the suite structurally
## could not, because nothing in it combined "many traits", "ridge on", and
## "single-trial Bernoulli" in one fit. This file is the standing guard
## against that class recurring: a moderate-width (p = 12, n = 60, d = 2),
## ridge-on, single-trial-Bernoulli fit that exercises B1 + B2 + #1092
## together, at a scale a hand-picked p=3 unit test cannot stand in for.
##
## This is a behavioural-contract test, not a recovery test: it asserts the
## fit reports itself converged and coherent, not that it recovers truth.

  ## (OLRE) term, matching the wide-format shape Ayumi's corpus actually
  ## fits, so `use_diag_W` is off and `sd_W` is not even REPORTed. Adding
  ## an OLRE term here would change this fixture's identity and runtime
  ## rather than guard anything new; the real ridge-relevant W-tier case
  ## (mixed-family + `indep(0 + trait | obs)`) already has its own
  ## dedicated real-fit regression test in
  ## test-mapped-off-boundary-flags.R. This assertion is the cheap
  ## regression guard that this fixture's flags stay clean of
  ## `near_zero_sd_W` too, trivially or otherwise.
