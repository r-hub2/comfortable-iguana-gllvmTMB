# Heavy-test gate for the fast/slow CI split.
#
# `R CMD check` sets NOT_CRAN=true, so `skip_on_cran()` does not fire on CI and
# every TMB fit would run on routine PRs. To keep routine PR CI fast we gate the
# slow recovery/matrix/profile/bootstrap tests behind an explicit env flag.
#
# Routine PR CI (R-CMD-check.yaml) leaves GLLVMTMB_HEAVY_TESTS unset -> the
# heavy tests skip and only the fast suite runs. The nightly/manual
# full-check.yaml workflow sets GLLVMTMB_HEAVY_TESTS=1 for a bounded Ubuntu
# package-regression check; release tags run that package gate across three
# OSes. Scientific simulation/recovery/coverage campaigns run on Totoro/DRAC,
# never GitHub Actions (D-50).
#
# This file is sourced automatically by testthat before any test file
# (files matching ^setup are run as setup, in addition to helper*.R).

# `fit$opt$convergence` is nlminb's PORT stopping code, NOT a statement about the
# quality of the optimum. On a flat likelihood PORT returns 1 = "false convergence
# (8)": the iterates appear to be converging but the relative-reduction test cannot
# be satisfied. That is a stopping rule, not a bad fit.
#
# Worse, WHICH code it returns can depend on the COLLATION LOCALE. Character factor
# levels (e.g. `site_species` = "10_1", "10_10", "10_100", ...) are ordered by
# collation; that order sets the random-effect indexing, hence the sparse-Cholesky
# fill-in, hence floating-point rounding, hence the optimiser's path. testthat sets
# `LC_COLLATE = "C"` (so does `R CMD check`), so a test can report a different status
# from the same fit run interactively.
#
# Verified 2026-07-08 on `test-phylo-q-decomposition.R` (seed 103, n_species = 100):
#   LC_COLLATE = C      -> convergence 1, "false convergence (8)",    obj 36622.108861,
#                          |grad|_inf 1.95e-02, 198 iterations
#   LC_COLLATE = en_AU  -> convergence 0, "relative convergence (4)", obj 36622.108862,
#                          |grad|_inf 4.69e-02, 206 iterations
# Identical data; the same optimum; the gradient is SMALLER in the "failing" case; and
# sigma2_Q recovers to 12.7% mean relative error under both. Raising the iteration
# budget 10x changes nothing (byte-identical objective and iteration count), so a
# larger `iter.max` is a no-op, not a fix.
#
# Recovery fixtures sometimes need to distinguish a stationary fitted scenario
# from a fully clean public fit. The helper below deliberately checks only the
# objective-scaled stationarity diagnostic; it must not be used as a public
# convergence certificate. Tests that make inference claims must inspect the
# optimiser code, raw gradient, and Hessian/SE health separately.
#
# NOTE: ~377 assertions across ~184 test files still use the bare
# `expect_equal(fit$opt$convergence, 0L)` form and share the locale fragility above.
# Migrating those is a separate mechanical sweep; `expect_stationary_for_recovery_test()` is the target.
