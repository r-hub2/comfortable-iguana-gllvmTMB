## Fencing on the exported total-variance profile route.
##
## `profile_ci_total_variance()` accepts five tiers, any family and any level,
## but the D-43 certificate (docs/dev-log/2026-07-29-certificate-disposition.md)
## covers exactly one regime: unpenalised native Laplace, Gaussian, tier "unit",
## d in {1,2}, n_units >= 150, level 0.95, converged. The `interval_status` column is what keeps the
## difference machine-visible, so it is what these tests pin.
##
## Deliberately fit-free: the labelling is a pure function of a handful of fit
## fields, and heavy tests are invisible to CI (798 skipped in a green run), so
## the fence itself must be checked in the light tier.

## A stub carrying only the fields the regime predicate reads.

## ---- The estimand may not change silently ---------------------------------
##
## `.total_variance_spec()` is the single source of truth for
## V_t = (Lambda Lambda^T)_tt + psi_t. When a tier carries loadings but no
## diagonal component there is no psi_t to add, and every psi term below it
## evaluates to zero -- so both routes keep reporting, but they report Sigma_tt
## under the name V_t. That silent substitution is what produced the coverage
## collapse 0.517 -> 0.300 -> 0.096 in the 2026-08-03 Step-0 pilot, with
## point-estimate gaps tracking the planted psi_t almost exactly. These tests pin
## the refusal so the estimand cannot drift again without a test failing.
