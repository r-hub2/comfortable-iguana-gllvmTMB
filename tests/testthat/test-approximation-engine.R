  ## refuse exactly what the validator refuses, no more and no less. A
  ## duplicated gate that drifts is worse than one gate, because the adapter
  ## would refuse a model the engine admits -- or admit one by a second route
  ## after the engine relaxed.
  ##
  ## `structured = TRUE` is still refused, on a sharper ground than before: a
