## #1092: `aghq_ridge` is applied at the R level, OUTSIDE the TMB objective, so
## `tmb_obj$gr()` is the gradient of a function the optimiser was NOT
## minimising. Every reader of that gradient -- `fit_health$max_gradient`
## first -- therefore reports a number with no reason to be near zero on a
## ridged fit, and the `converged` conjunction reads a genuinely converged
## MAP fit as unconverged. At the penalised optimum the raw gradient on the
## loading block is exactly `|lambda| / tau^2` (the missing ridge term), which
## for a ridged Bernoulli toy sits ~0.44 against a gtol of 1e-2.
##
## The contract under test: gradient-based convergence reporting must judge
## the objective the fit actually optimised. Raw-vs-penalised remains
## DISCLOSED (the raw gradient stays reachable via `tmb_obj$gr()` and the
## fit_health surface labels the penalised reading), mirroring how
## `.aghq_check_penalised()` disclosed the logLik/AIC half of the same defect.
