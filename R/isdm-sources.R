## Multi-source integrated-SDM declaration (Design 120, issue #941).
##
## The two-source admission validated a hard-coded gbif/survey_pa shape. The
## declared contract replaces pattern-matching with declaration: the user names
## every source and states its observation law, and the predicate validates the
## data against that declaration. The two-source route remains admitted as the
## n = 2 instance of the same core (see .gllvmTMB_integrated_sources_contract).

## The admitted laws, and why only these: coherence is an arm-by-arm property
## against the shared intensity (Design 120 section 2). An arm's inverse link
## must express its mean as a function of a * exp(eta) -- true of Poisson-log
## (log E[Y] = eta + log a) and Bernoulli-cloglog (p = 1 - exp(-a e^eta), the
## chance a Poisson thinning is non-zero), false of logit/probit, and false of
## every dispersion-carrying family (#945 wrinkle 1).

#' Declare one iSDM source observation model
#'
#' Wraps an admitted observation law with the source-specific fixed-effects
#' formula that describes recording effort or observation bias. The ecological
#' formula remains in [gllvmTMB()]; `observation` contributes columns only on
#' rows from this declared source. It is therefore not a second ecological
#' process and does not turn relative intensity into abundance, occupancy, or
#' detectability.
#'
#' @param family An admitted family law, currently [poisson()] with its log
#'   link or [binomial()] with `link = "cloglog"`.
#' @param observation A one-sided formula for source-specific observation
#'   effects, for example `~ access + popdens` or `~ observer + method`.
#'   Do not add `0 +` merely to make source formulas identifiable: the wrapper
#'   keeps the ecological design first and automatically reference-codes any
#'   aliased source-observation columns.
#' @return An internal source declaration accepted by [isdm_sources()].
#' @examples
#' isdm_source(poisson(link = "log"), observation = ~ access + popdens)

#' Declare the sources of a multi-source integrated model
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' Builds the `family` argument for an integrated species-distribution fit in
#' which any number of named observation sources -- an opportunistic portal
#' stream, digitised literature records, checklists, a structured survey --
#' share one ecological linear predictor while each source keeps its own
#' observation law.
#'
#' Each argument is named for a source and gives either a bare observation law
#' or [isdm_source()] with its source-specific observation formula. Two laws
#' are admitted, because both express the observation as a thinning of one
#' shared intensity: `poisson()` (a count stream; the offset is log effort) and
#' `binomial("cloglog")` (detection/non-detection; the offset is log support,
#' and the complementary log-log link is what makes a detection consistent with
#' the same intensity that generates the counts). Other links and families are
#' refused: a logit detection model, for instance, does not share a scale with
#' a count arm merely because both converge.
#'
#' The data must carry an `isdm_source` column whose values are exactly the
#' declared source names, and -- when the declaration mixes the two laws --
#' every trait must be observed by every declared source. Everything such a
#' fit reports is relative intensity: presence-only data cannot identify
#' absolute abundance, occupancy, or detectability, and none are estimated.
#' This interface is experimental and may change.
#'
#' @param ... Two or more named arguments; each name is a source label and each
#'   value is a bare admitted observation law or an [isdm_source()] declaration.
#'   At least one source must be a count stream: the detection arm's offset is
#'   admitted only alongside a count arm sharing the same intensity, so an
#'   all-detection declaration is refused here rather than failing later.
#' @return A mixed-family list understood by [gllvmTMB()], with
#'   `family_var = "isdm_source"`. (The `isdm_source_laws` attribute is
#'   informational only: internal validation rebuilds the declaration from the
#'   list's names and laws, which survive reordering; the attribute does not.)
