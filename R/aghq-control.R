## `.aghq_grid(d, k)` -- the d-dimensional tensor Gauss-Hermite grid, ready for
## ADAPTIVE consumption: nodes on the standard-normal (probabilists') scale,
## and `logw` already carrying BOTH the exp(u'u) adaptive correction AND the
## sqrt(2)^d change-of-variables constant, so the template needs nothing but
## `exp(logw + aghq_logdet) * h(node)` -- no GH convention of its own.
##
## Derivation (Liu & Pierce 1994; this is the textbook adaptive-quadrature
## identity, verified below by the moment self-test, not a free design
## choice):
##   - Golub-Welsch gives physicists' nodes u_i, weights w_i for
##       integral f(x) exp(-x^2) dx  ~=  sum_i w_i f(u_i),  sum_i w_i = sqrt(pi).
##   - Adaptive quadrature at a site with mode x_hat and local Cholesky factor
##     L (from the site's Hessian; aghq_Lt/aghq_logdet in the DATA contract)
##     substitutes x = x_hat + sqrt(2) * L * u, whose Jacobian is
##     (sqrt(2))^d * det(L). Writing the true (possibly non-Gaussian-shaped)
##     integrand h(x) = f(u) * exp(-u'u) for a locally-well-behaved f gives
##       integral h(x) dx
##         ~= (sqrt(2))^d * det(L) * sum_i w_i * exp(u_i'u_i) * h(x_hat + sqrt(2) L u_i).
##   - We split that constant in two: `det(L)` is SITE-specific and lives in
##     the caller's `aghq_logdet` (not here); `(sqrt(2))^d` is universal
##     (function of d alone) and is folded into `logw` here, together with
##     the `exp(u_i'u_i)` correction, so the template only ever needs
##     `exp(logw_row + aghq_logdet_site) * h(node)` and never has to know
##     sqrt(2)^d exists. In probabilists' node coordinates z = sqrt(2)*u, the
##     per-dimension log-weight is therefore
##       log(w_i) + u_i^2 + 0.5*log(2)     (NOT divided by sqrt(pi): dividing
##     by sqrt(pi) would be the right constant for a NON-adaptive expectation
##     sum_i (w_i/sqrt(pi)) g(z_i) ~= E[g(Z)], but here `h` is the FULL joint
##     integrand -- likelihood times the latent Gaussian prior -- not `g`
##     alone, and folding in a stray sqrt(pi) division breaks exact recovery
##     of the identity-adaptation moment identities, confirmed by
##     `.aghq_grid_selftest()` below).
##   - The tensor grid over d dimensions has k^d rows; nodes[, j] is
##     dimension j's z-coordinate (probabilists' scale, unadapted at mode 0,
##     scale I), and logw is the log of the per-row product weight.

## `sum_i exp(logw_i) * h(node_i)` with `h(z) = g(z) * phi(z)` (the
## observation density times the standard-normal latent prior -- exactly what
## a per-site AGHQ nll contribution looks like with the likelihood replaced by
## a known polynomial g). This must recover E[g(Z)], Z ~ N(0,1), EXACTLY (up
## to floating point) for polynomial g of degree <= 2k-1, for both k and the
## exp(u'u)-correction/Jacobian folding to be correct -- an error in either

## and adaptive Gaussian quadrature algorithms for multilevel generalized
## linear mixed models"): they measured the AGHQ-over-Laplace gain falling
## from 5-15% at d=1 with ~5 observations per cluster, to 2-5% at d=2 with 20,
## to three-decimal agreement (i.e. negligible) at d=3 with >= 30. The
## observations-per-cluster axis in THIS package is n_traits per site (the
## stacked-trait "cluster" at one latent-variable site), not the number of
## sites. We decline auto-AGHQ once n_traits >= 20: below Pinheiro & Chao's
## d=2/n=20 cell the gain is still in the few-percent range and worth 3^q-9^q
## extra cost; at or above it, cost keeps climbing (k^(q+1)) while the
## measured payoff is already approaching the three-decimal floor, so
