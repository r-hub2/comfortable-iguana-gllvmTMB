## Lazy standard errors: fit fast with `gllvmTMBcontrol(se = FALSE)`, then
## compute the TMB `sdreport()` afterwards, on demand.
##
## The fit object already carries everything the calculation needs -- the TMB
## ADFun (`fit$tmb_obj`) and the optimiser result (`fit$opt`) -- so this is the
## same single production `sdreport()` call the fit would have made at
## R/fit-multi.R:6087, deferred rather than skipped.
##
## The internal-state replay below mirrors R/fit-multi.R:6058-6078, so the lazy
## call is the fit-time call. What it does and does not buy was MEASURED rather
## than assumed (2026-08-04), because the fit-time comment is easy to over-read:
##
##   * `TMB::sdreport()` reads `env$last.par.best`, not `env$last.par`.
##   * An ordinary extractor call -- `obj$fn()`, `obj$report()` -- moves
##     `last.par` but does NOT move `last.par.best`. So the realistic "another
##     extractor ran first" scenario does not perturb this calculation at all:
##     with the state deliberately moved that way, results are bit-identical
##     with the replay, without the replay, and without `par.fixed`.
##   * Directly overwriting `last.par.best` DOES change the answer (measured:
##     max |SE diff| 0.20), and the replay does NOT recover from it. Nothing in
##     this package writes that field except fit time, which writes the correct
##     value, so this is a pathological case rather than a live failure mode --
##     but the replay must not be described as a guard against it.
##
## The replay is therefore kept as cheap fidelity to the fit-time path, not as
## a correctness guarantee it does not provide.

#' Compute standard errors after fitting
#'
#' [gllvmTMB()] computes a TMB [TMB::sdreport()] at fitting time unless it is
#' told not to (`control = gllvmTMBcontrol(se = FALSE)`). Skipping it is
#' substantially faster, but it used to be a one-way door: the only way to get
#' standard errors afterwards was to fit the model again. `standard_errors()`
#' removes that door by computing the same `sdreport()` on demand from the
#' fitted object.
#'
#' Fits made with non-unit likelihood weights use a weighted objective rather
#' than an ordinary likelihood. `standard_errors()` refuses those fits because
#' the package does not yet provide sandwich-calibrated uncertainty for them;
#' point estimates remain available from the fitted model.
#'
#' @param fit A fitted multivariate model returned by [gllvmTMB()].
#'
#' @return The same fit, with its `sd_report` field populated (and
#'   `sdreport_error` cleared). Standard-error consumers such as
#'   [summary.gllvmTMB_multi()], [getLV()], [getREsd()], and
#'   `confint(method = "wald")` work on the returned object.
#'
#'   R semantics matter here: the fit is **returned**, not modified in place.
#'   Assign the result -- `fit <- standard_errors(fit)` -- or the standard
#'   errors are discarded.
#'
#'   If the fit already has an `sd_report`, it is returned unchanged; the
#'   calculation is not repeated.
#'
#' @section When this helps:
#' The saving is real but bounded: it is worth using when a workflow fits many
#' models and needs standard errors for only some of them (model selection,
#' simulation loops, a grid of candidate structures). For a single fit whose
#' summary you intend to read, the default `se = TRUE` is simpler and costs
#' nothing extra.
#'
#' @section Same-session only:
#' A TMB ADFun object holds external pointers into compiled memory. Those
#' pointers do not survive `saveRDS()` / `readRDS()` or a new R session, so
#' `standard_errors()` can only be called on a fit made in the *current*
#' session. This is a pre-existing property of every function in this package
#' that reuses `fit$tmb_obj` (profiling, bootstrapping, `getLV()`), not a new
#' restriction -- but this function names it with a clear error rather than
#' failing obscurely. If you need standard errors from a saved fit, refit it
#' with `se = TRUE`.
#'
#' @section What these standard errors are:
#' Exactly the ones the fit would have produced at fitting time -- the same
#' TMB `sdreport()` call, on the same converged parameter vector, to the bit.
#' Deferring the calculation does not change it, and does not change any
#' honesty caveat that already applies to Wald standard errors from this
#' package.
#'
#' @seealso [gllvmTMBcontrol()] for the `se` argument that defers the
#'   calculation; [getREsd()] and [getLV()] for accessors that read the
#'   resulting `sd_report`.
#' @export
