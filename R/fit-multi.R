## Issue #1120: a mixed-family `list()` pairs its i-th entry with the i-th
## LEVEL of the selector column (`levels()` for a factor, `sort(unique(...))`
## for anything else). When the list is unnamed there are two candidate
## readings of "i-th": the order the user wrote the list in (POSITIONAL), and
## the order implied by each family object's OWN name matching a level's text
## (NAME-RESOLVED, e.g. a `"student"` level naturally means `student()`). They
## coincide whenever the user's list order already matches level order --
## which is most of the time, including every case in this package's own test
## suite -- so gating on "is this named" alone (an earlier draft of this fix)
## would error on a lot of code that was never wrong. What is never safe to
## guess is a level whose name-evidence DISAGREES with where the list put it:
## that disagreement is exactly the #1120 defect (`list(student(), gaussian())`
## against `family = rep(c("student","gaussian"), each = n)` silently paired
## the student rows with `gaussian()` and vice versa). So: compute both
## readings, proceed silently when they agree (nothing was ever ambiguous),
## and abort loudly -- showing both readings -- when they disagree. When no
## level has any name evidence at all (arbitrary labels like "count" /
## "binary"), positional is the only available reading; take it, but report
## the resolved pairing once so it is auditable rather than assumed. A level
## whose text matches more than one family object's own name, or a family
## list where some levels have name evidence and others don't, is refused as
## ambiguous rather than partially guessed.

    ## fixed-effect block out under a flat prior. For a Gaussian LMM that step is
    ## EXACT and returns the classical restricted likelihood -- which is why this

    ## likelihood (Cox & Reid 1987) -- REML generalised to non-Gaussian.
    ## Exactness was never the requirement; Cox-Reid is DEFINED as that adjustment.
    ##
    ## WHY IT MATTERS HERE. Small-cluster variance-component bias has two stacked
    ## ORTHOGONAL parts and quadrature fixes only one. Measured cross-repo
    ## (2026-07-18, drmTMB cumulative_logit, 40 seeds, against glmmTMB/glmer/lme4):
    ## Laplace -7.3% -> +AGHQ -5.0% -> +Cox-Reid -0.9%, with the AGHQ node sweep
    ## PLATEAUING DEAD FLAT. Nodes cannot cross the variance-bias floor.
    ## This package's own n-ladder shows the same thing from the other side
    ## (dev/aghq-evidence/05-descend-RESULT.txt, T=4, q=1, ratio ||L_hat||/||L_true||):
    ##   n=3200 Laplace 0.794 / AGHQ 1.0021   <- AGHQ essentially unbiased
    ##   n= 200 Laplace 0.836 / AGHQ 1.967    <- AGHQ worse; the residual is NOT
    ##   n= 100 Laplace 0.892 / AGHQ 1.893       the quadrature but the ML variance
    ## Laplace's small-n adequacy is TWO ERRORS CANCELLING -- its integral error
    ## biases down, the small-sample variance bias biases up -- not accuracy. The
    ## cancellation is uncontrolled and breaks with T, family or signal strength.
    ## The lever below targets the half that AGHQ cannot reach.
    ##
    ## OPT-IN AND UNVALIDATED HERE. Two caveats worth respecting rather than
    ## rediscovering (Reid & Fraser 2003): Cox-Reid is strictly justified when the
    ## interest parameter is ORTHOGONAL to the nuisance block, and it is NOT
    ## invariant to reparametrising that block. Neither is checked for the GLLVM
    ## parameterisation, where variance lives in Lambda and Psi rather than in a

  ## Loading start, on the scale of the data (issue #851). The loadings carry

  ## precisely what pushes that scale into Lambda -- so a hardcoded 0.5 assumed
  ## sd(y) ~ 1, and above a scale threshold the ordination collapsed with every
  ## convergence signal green. `resid_init` is the right yardstick and is
  ## already family-aware (raw y for gaussian, the working response otherwise);
  ## `.gllvmTMB_log_sigma_eps_start()` keys off the same vector. The 0.5 is kept
  ## as the coefficient, so a working residual sd of 1 reproduces the historical
  ## start exactly.
  ##
  ## GAUSSIAN-ONLY, on the same rule that scopes this to one tier: apply the
  ## scale where it was MEASURED, and nowhere it was not. "Multiply the response
  ## by k" is only a meaningful perturbation for an unbounded continuous
  ## response; every #851 measurement is gaussian. For a binomial fit y is 0/1
  ## and there is no response scale to get wrong, yet keying off the working
  ## residual still moved those fits -- measurably, and for no reason the
  ## evidence supports: it perturbed a binomial AGHQ cell (`.ms_cell()` in
  ## `test-aghq-multistart-convergence.R`) from objective 379.7134 to 380.5439.
  ## Gating restores that cell EXACTLY (379.7133, loading-runaway ratio 29.700,
  ## identical to main) and leaves every gaussian result untouched: the
  ## two-tier oracle is byte-identical gated and ungated at k = 100 and
  ## k = 5000 (6.15e-06 / 7.19e-06 / 7.27e-06 / 1.38e-05 and 0.0102 / 0.0131 /
  ## 0.011 / 0.0187), because those models are gaussian and so take this branch.
  ##
  ## This is a narrowing, not a retreat. Counts on a large scale may well have
  ## the same defect -- but that is UNMEASURED, and #851's own argument for
  ## leaving five tiers alone was that moving an unmeasured start trades a known

  ## ---- Per-family-aware OLRE selection (W-tier) ------------------------
  ## When a diagonal term is at the per-row level, the resulting per-trait
  ## random effects on the linear predictor are an observation-level random
  ## effect (OLRE). For some response families OLRE is unidentifiable or
  ## biologically suspect; we handle these per trait so that mixed-family fits
  ## do the right thing for each trait.
  ##
  ## Family-id table for OLRE handling (W-tier, per-row regime):
  ##   * fid 1 (binomial), all rows single-trial (n_trials == 1): SKIP
  ##     OLRE for that trait. Single-trial Bernoulli OLRE has no
  ##     within-cell information to identify the variance (Nakagawa &
  ##     Schielzeth 2010). The MLE is sd_W[t] -> 0; mapping the
  ##     parameter off makes the unidentifiability explicit and removes
  ##     a spurious free parameter.
  ##   * fid 12, 13 (delta_lognormal / delta_gamma): WARN. The OLRE
  ##     enters the shared linear predictor of the hurdle, which mixes
  ##     presence and abundance noise; the resulting variance estimate
  ##     is hard to interpret biologically. The fit is still allowed.
  ##   * all other single families (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)
  ##     and mixed-within-trait combinations: fit OLRE normally.
  ##
  ## Multi-trial binomial (cbind(succ, fail) or weights = n_trials with
  ## n_trials > 1) is identifiable in principle, so we leave the trait
  ## estimable in that case. Mixed Bernoulli + non-Bernoulli within a
  ## single trait (which we expect to be rare) is also left estimable
  ## because the non-Bernoulli rows contribute identifying information.

  ## Optimiser dispatch: nlminb (default) or optim with user-supplied
  ## method (per Maeve McGillycuddy's email — optim/BFGS is often more
  ## robust than nlminb for two-level rr fits).
  ## `.obj` defaults to the Laplace object built above; the AGHQ adaptation
  ## loop passes its own object so it reuses this exact optimiser dispatch.
  ## `.iter_cap` bounds the optimiser steps taken in ONE call. The AGHQ adaptation
  ## loop uses it to keep the quadrature nodes fresh; see the loop for why that is
  ## not optional.
  ## `.ridge_tau` adds a weakly-informative Gaussian prior on the free loadings:
  ##     penalty = 0.5 * sum(theta_rr_B^2) / tau^2
  ## Its gradient is exactly theta_rr_B / tau^2, so this stays AD-exact with no
  ## template change and no recompile -- the ridge's derivative is trivial.
  ##
  ## WHY IT EXISTS. With the integral solved exactly by AGHQ, what remains at small n
  ## is a nearly FLAT likelihood ridge along the direction that inflates Sigma: at one
  ## converged optimum, sweeping k = 5/9/15/21 moves the objective < 0.01 nll while
  ## the argmin's ||Sigma_B||_F wanders 13.3 / 45.5 / 119.3 / 38.6. The data barely
  ## distinguishes those solutions, so a fraction of fits walk out along the ridge.
  ## Nothing that improves the INTEGRAL can help -- only something that adds CURVATURE
  ## where the likelihood has none.
  ##
  ## WHY tau = 2, fixed a priori and not tuned against any truth. The latent variables
  ## are standardised N(0, I), so a loading IS the trait's latent SD contribution in
  ## logit units: a loading of 1 swings occurrence 0.27-0.73 across +/-1 SD, 4 swings
  ## 0.018-0.98, 10 saturates. tau = 2 therefore barely touches anything plausible
  ## while making a runaway astronomically unlikely. And a FIXED prior contributes
  ## O(1) to a log-likelihood growing as O(n), so it vanishes as n grows.
  ##
  ## MEASURED (Totoro, 954 fits, 30 seeds/cell, p=6 q=2 binomial; sigma = ratio of
  ## estimated to true latent SD, 1.000 unbiased; rho = mean |error| of the
  ## correlations; runaway = fraction with ||Lambda|| ratio > 2):
  ##        n     engine        sigma    rho    runaway
  ##      100   Laplace         0.825  0.310      50%

  ##     1600   AGHQ + ridge    0.989  0.062       0%
  ## The ridge removes the runaway entirely at this shape, improves BOTH sigma and rho

  ## Note also that LAPLACE runs away MORE than AGHQ here (50% vs 13%), not less.

  ## The penalty is rotation-invariant: ||Lambda Q||_F = ||Lambda||_F for orthogonal Q,

      ## binomial): the objective ties in 13/40, NOT 40/40 -- and 0/16 on the seeds
      ## that ran away catastrophically. On those 16 the runaway is provably NOT the
      ## maximum-likelihood solution: started at the truth the same engine reaches a
      ## strictly better objective on 16/16, by 1.14 to 12.94 nll.

      ## adaptation points are DATA_), so a pass minimises the SURROGATE
      ## F(theta; theta_k) with the nodes pinned at theta_k. F is recovered for
      ## free at the TOP of the next pass: after re-adapting at the new theta,
      ## `obj_try$fn(theta)` IS F(theta). Two things follow, and both are new:
      ##
      ##  1. CONVERGENCE IS TESTED ON F, NOT ON THE SURROGATE. The old rule
      ##     compared surrogate values across passes -- values computed on
      ##     DIFFERENT tapes -- so its "objective gain" mixed real progress with
      ##     the change in quadrature error from re-adapting, and never fell below
      ##     its 1e-8 threshold. It converged by exhausting aghq_n_adapt instead.
      ##     The rule here is stationarity of the AD-exact gradient of the
      ##     surrogate at its own adaptation point (max |grad| < aghq_grad_tol)
      ##     together with a settled adaptation point (max |mode shift| <
      ##     aghq_shift_tol); at a fixed point of the adaptation map those two
      ##     conditions ARE stationarity of F.
      ##
      ##  2. A STEP THAT RAISES F IS REJECTED. That single test is what makes a
      ##     larger cap safe: a runaway is precisely a step that looks good
      ##     against stale nodes and is worse under honest ones, so it is caught
      ##     on the next pass, the iterate is rolled back to the last honest one,
      ##     and the cap drops to 1.
      ##
      ## CONTINUATION. Cap 1 is robust but slow (a fresh nlminb rebuilds its
      ## curvature model from scratch every pass, so it takes a first-iteration
      ## step forever). The schedule starts at 1 to escape the runaway regime and
      ## escalates 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 25 -> uncapped as the adaptation point settles,
      ## with the rejection test above as the safety net. Setting

  ## ---- Force TMB internal state to the selected optimum --------------
  ## After the multi-start loop, TMB's internal `obj$env$last.par` is
  ## whatever the FINAL restart evaluated last -- not necessarily
  ## `best_opt$par`. `obj$env$last.par.best` is TMB's globally-best-seen
  ## evaluation, which is usually `best_opt$par` but can disagree in
  ## pathological cases (a restart's optimizer transiently visited
  ## better params and walked away).
  ##
  ## Without this block, `obj$report()` (default arg is `last.par`)
  ## returned report values for the LAST restart's last step rather
  ## than for `opt$par`. Every downstream extractor reading
  ## `fit$report` -- extract_Sigma, extract_correlations,
  ## extract_communality, extract_phylo_signal, ordination,
  ## communality, repeatability, plot.gllvmTMB_multi, ... -- then
  ## reported quantities inconsistent with `fit$opt$par` and
  ## `fit$opt$objective`. The bug only manifested when restart-1
  ## won AND restart-N (N > 1) ran last.
  ##
  ## Fix: (1) re-evaluate `obj$fn(opt$par)` so the inner optim runs
  ## at the selected fixed-effect optimum AND `obj$env$last.par`
  ## gets re-populated with the FULL parameter vector (fixed-effect
  ## block = `opt$par`, random-effect block = the conditional mode
  ## of RE given `opt$par`); (2) force `last.par.best <- last.par`
  ## so downstream consumers reading `last.par.best`
  ## (R/plot.R, R/extractors.R, R/extract-repeatability.R,
  ## R/methods-gllvmTMB.R) also see `opt$par`-aligned values;
  ## (3) call `obj$report()` with no args (so it reads the just-
  ## forced `last.par`) and `TMB::sdreport(obj, par.fixed = opt$par,
  ## ...)` with explicit `par.fixed = opt$par` so the report and
  ## sdreport are self-consistent regardless of TMB's internal-state
  ## quirks. NOTE: `obj$report(opt$par)` would be incorrect --
  ## `obj$report()` expects the FULL parameter vector (fixed + RE),
  ## not just the fixed-effects-only `opt$par`. The correct idiom
  ## is `obj$fn(opt$par); obj$report()`.

## i.e. `latent(..., unique = FALSE)` with z_B the ONLY random block. Every
## other model class still runs the Laplace path unchanged.
##
## Division of labour with the template (src/gllvmTMB.cpp): R computes the
## adaptation points (conditional modes + Cholesky factors) and the tensor
## quadrature grid and passes them in as DATA_, so the template stays
## differentiable in the fixed parameters and TMB supplies exact gradients.

## Inert AGHQ DATA slots. Shape-valid stubs; `use_aghq = 0` short-circuits
## every use of them in the template.

## Resolve `control$aghq` into a node count. FALSE / NULL -> NULL (Laplace).
## "auto" -> the ladder start from `.aghq_resolve()`, else 9.
##
## The ON/OFF decision for "auto" is NOT made here -- it belongs to
## `.aghq_auto_gate()` in the fit-time eligibility chain, which is the only
## place the `.aghq_gate()` table exists. This function answers "how many
## nodes", never "should we".
##
## `.aghq_resolve()` also returns `optimizer` and `optArgs`, and this function
## deliberately keeps only `k`. That is a PROVABLE NO-OP on this path, not an
## oversight, and it should stay that way unless someone brings evidence:
## `.aghq_optimizer_table()` returns "lbfgsb" only for family = binomial with a
## "jj" tier, and the AGHQ path always calls `.aghq_resolve(family, "B", ...)`.
## Checked by evaluation across gaussian/poisson/binomial/nbinom2/Gamma/beta/
## tweedie at tier "B": every one returns "nlminb", which is already
## `control$optimizer`'s default. So the discarded recommendation would change
## nothing, and the un-`factr`'d lbfgsb hazard the table's own comment warns
## about is unreachable from quadrature. Wiring it through would be a
## results-changing edit with no measured benefit behind it.
