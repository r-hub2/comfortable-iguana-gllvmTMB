## `offset()` support, scoped to count families -- issue #833.
##
## An offset is a KNOWN per-row addition to the linear predictor, carrying no
## coefficient: eta = offset + X b. On a log link that is the exposure/effort
## idiom (a multiplicative rate adjustment), which is why the feature is gated
## to count families rather than offered everywhere. On an identity link it
## would be an unexplained mean shift and on a logit link a fixed shift in
## log-odds -- neither is what a user asking for an offset wants.
##
## Gating on family rather than link keeps the admitted set small and
## enumerable, and sweeps in nothing awkward: a link gate would admit Gamma,
## lognormal and Tweedie on log links, each needing its own semantics call.
##
## The parser holds the offset expression out of the fixed-effect formula
## (R/parse-multi-formula.R); `model.matrix()` drops offset terms, and a
## dropped offset is silently ignored -- the bug #807 fixed.

## Count families the engine supports. See the family_id map in R/fit-multi.R:
##   2 poisson, 5 nbinom2, 10 truncated_poisson, 11 truncated_nbinom2,
##   15 nbinom1.
## truncated_nbinom1 is not in the engine at all, so it is not a candidate.

#' Evaluate and validate a formula offset
#'
#' Turns `parsed$offset_expr` into a per-row numeric vector, and refuses a
#' nonzero offset on any row whose family is not a count family.
#'
#' A zero offset is always allowed. That is not a loophole: an offset of 0 is a
#' multiplier of 1 on the response scale, so it genuinely does nothing. It is
#' also what makes a mixed-family fit expressible -- the user zeroes the offset
#' on the non-count traits and keeps it on the counts.
#'
#' @param offset_expr The inner expression of the `offset(...)` term, or `NULL`.
#' @param data The (long-format) model data.
#' @param formula_env Environment to fall back on when evaluating `offset_expr`.
#' @param family_id_vec Per-row family ids.
#' @param family_per_row Per-row family objects, used to name the offending
#'   family in the error.
#' @param trait_vec Per-row trait labels, used to name the offending trait.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of length `nrow(data)`; all zeros when
#'   `offset_expr` is `NULL`.
#'
#' The training-row offset stored on a fit
#'
#' Row-aligned with `fit$tmb_data$X_fix`. Returns zeros for a fit made before
#' offsets existed, or one whose formula carried none.
