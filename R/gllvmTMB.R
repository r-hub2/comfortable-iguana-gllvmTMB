#' Fit multivariate response models from wide or long data
#'
#' Top-level entry point for models with several responses per site,
#' individual, species, or study. Start from a wide data frame with
#' [traits()] on the formula left-hand side, or from already-stacked long
#' data with one row per `(unit, trait)` observation. Both routes estimate
#' the same trait covariance, pairwise correlations, shared latent axes,
#' and trait-specific variance. The formula syntax also supports fixed
#' effects plus covariance-structure keywords organised by
#' \emph{correlation source} (none / animal / phylo / spatial / kernel) and
#' three \emph{modes} (independent / dependent / latent). The `common = TRUE`
#' modifier on `*_indep()` gives the one-shared-variance special case:
#'
#' \tabular{llll}{
#'   \strong{source \\ mode} \tab \strong{independent} \tab \strong{dependent} \tab \strong{latent} \cr
#'   \emph{none}    \tab [indep()]         \tab [dep()]         \tab [latent()]         \cr
#'   \emph{animal}  \tab [animal_indep()]  \tab [animal_dep()]  \tab [animal_latent()]  \cr
#'   \emph{phylo}   \tab [phylo_indep()]   \tab [phylo_dep()]   \tab [phylo_latent()]   \cr
#'   \emph{spatial} \tab [spatial_indep()] \tab [spatial_dep()] \tab [spatial_latent()] \cr
#'   \emph{kernel}  \tab [kernel_indep()]  \tab [kernel_dep()]  \tab [kernel_latent()]  \cr
#' }
#'
#' The grid lists available syntax. Reliability depends on the family
#' and uncertainty method. Gaussian `indep()` and `dep()` point fits are the
#' narrow tested starting routes; structured-source and non-Gaussian routes
#' need their named evidence boundary. General interval coverage is not claimed.
#'
#' The three covariance modes (`indep` / `dep` / `latent`) encode
#' covstruct intent across traits:
#'
#' * `latent`: the **decomposition** mode
#'   \eqn{\boldsymbol\Sigma = \boldsymbol\Lambda \boldsymbol\Lambda^\top + \boldsymbol\Psi}:
#'   a low-rank shared part plus a diagonal \eqn{\boldsymbol\Psi} companion.
#'   Ordinary `latent()` carries \eqn{\boldsymbol\Psi} by default; the
#'   `unique =` argument controls it (`latent(..., unique = FALSE)` for the
#'   loadings-only subset, `*_latent(..., unique = TRUE)` to fold the
#'   \eqn{\boldsymbol\Psi} companion into a source-specific term).
#' * `indep`: the **marginal-only** mode: each trait gets its own
#'   variance, no cross-trait covariance.
#' * `dep`: the **full unstructured** mode: \eqn{\boldsymbol\Sigma}
#'   is free with \eqn{T(T+1)/2} parameters via a Cholesky factor.
#'
#' Plus the supporting [phylo_slope()] / [animal_slope()] (random
#' slopes), [meta_V()] (known-V meta-analytic; [meta_known_V()] is a
#' deprecated alias), and the engine-internal `propto()` /
#' `equalto()` covstructs (used by the canonical keywords above; not
#' typically called directly). See the
#' [formula keyword grid article](https://itchyshin.github.io/gllvmTMB/articles/api-keyword-grid.html)
#' for a one-paragraph tour of each cell.
#'
#' @param formula A glmmTMB-style formula, e.g.
#'   `value ~ 0 + trait + (0 + trait):env_temp + (0 + trait):env_precip`.
#'   Fixed effects and any of the three-mode grid covstructs above are
#'   supported (plus [phylo_slope()], [animal_slope()], and [meta_V()]).
#'
#'   An `offset()` term is supported for **count responses only**: `poisson()`,
#'   `nbinom1()`, `nbinom2()`, `truncated_poisson()`, and
#'   `truncated_nbinom2()`. There it is the usual exposure or effort
#'   adjustment. Supply it already on the link scale, e.g.
#'   `offset(log(trap_nights))`. It must be its own additive term; it is not
#'   interacted with `trait`.
#'
#'   In long format the offset column carries one value per `(unit, trait)`
#'   row, so it can differ by trait. In wide format, `offset(w)` names one
#'   unit-level column and applies it to every trait, while
#'   `offset(e1, e2, ...)` names one column per trait, in [traits()] order.
#'
#'   A **nonzero** offset on a non-count trait is an error naming that trait.
#'   Zero is always allowed and does nothing (on the log scale it is a
#'   multiplier of one), which is how a mixed-family model gives an offset to
#'   its count traits and not the rest.
#' @param data A data frame. With an ordinary response LHS such as
#'   `value ~ ...`, `data` is long: one row per `(unit, trait)`
#'   observation, with the trait column named by `trait`. With a
#'   [traits()] LHS, `data` is wide: one row per unit and one column per
#'   response named inside `traits(...)`. Missing response values are
#'   allowed: by default they are dropped before fitting, while
#'   `missing = miss_control(response = "include")` masks them out of the
#'   likelihood and keeps original-row accounting for [predict_missing()].
#'   Ordinary missing predictors, grouping variables, and design-matrix values
#'   still error; explicitly modelled missing predictors use `mi(x)` with
#'   `missing = miss_control(predictor = "model")` and `impute = list(...)`.
#' @param trait Name of the column holding the trait factor (the
#'   "trait" dimension of the unit × trait response matrix). Default
#'   `"trait"`.
#' @param unit Name of the column holding the **between-unit** grouping
#'   factor (the "unit" dimension of the unit × trait response matrix).
#'   Examples: `"site"` for site × species data, `"individual"` for
#'   behavioural-syndrome data, `"species"` for PGLLVM, `"paper"` for
#'   systematic mapping. Default `"site"`.
#' @param unit_obs Optional. Name of the column holding the **within-unit**
#'   grouping factor, with one level per (unit, replicate) cell, used by
#'   `latent(0 + trait | unit_obs, ...)` and
#'   `indep(0 + trait | unit_obs)` for the W-tier covariance.
#'   Default `NULL`, which resolves to `"site_species"` (the conventional
#'   name in joint species distribution modelling; safe for site × species
#'   data). If your data has no such column, omit `unit_obs`; the engine
#'   synthesises it from `unit` × `cluster`. For other domains pass e.g.
#'   `unit_obs = "obs"` for behavioural syndromes. If supplied but no
#'   covariance keyword uses that column, [gllvmTMB()] warns; omit the
#'   argument or use the column in the intended covariance keyword.
#' @param site (deprecated) alias for `unit`. Kept for backward
#'   compatibility. Use `unit = ...` in new code.
#' @param cluster Optional. Name of the column holding the **third
#'   grouping** factor (the "cluster" slot). When the column name matches
#'   the row/column names of `phylo_vcv` (or the tip labels of
#'   `phylo_tree`), this slot also drives the phylogenetic random
#'   effects (`phylo_latent`, `phylo_scalar`, `phylo_indep`,
#'   `phylo_slope`). When the column does **not** match a phylogenetic
#'   correlation, the slot still functions as a regular crossed/nested
#'   third grouping (e.g. `cluster = "population"` for 3-level
#'   personality data, `cluster = "study"` for multi-study
#'   meta-analysis). Default `NULL`, which resolves to `"species"`. For
#'   datasets with no third grouping the column may be absent from `data`
#'   entirely (with or without passing `cluster`); the engine will
#'   synthesise a placeholder. If supplied but no covariance keyword uses
#'   that column, [gllvmTMB()] warns; omit the argument or use the column in
#'   the intended covariance keyword.
#'
#'   The engine does **not** enforce nesting between `unit_obs`,
#'   `unit`, and `cluster`; crossed and nested designs both fit. Two
#'   canonical patterns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item Functional biogeography (crossed): `unit = "site"`,
#'           `unit_obs = "site_species"`, `cluster = "species"`. Sites
#'           and species are crossed; `site_species` indexes the
#'           intersection cell.
#'     \item 3-level personality (strictly nested): `unit =
#'           "individual"`, `unit_obs = "session_id"`,
#'           `cluster = "population"`.
#'   }
#' @param cluster2 Optional name of the column holding a **second
#'   independent grouping** factor (the "cluster2" slot), for fitting two
#'   crossed (or nested) plain diagonal per-trait variance components at
#'   once. Default `NULL` (slot inactive). It is a plain crossed/nested
#'   diagonal grouping only -- it carries no phylogenetic or spatial
#'   correlation (those stay bound to `cluster` / `coords`). A
#'   `indep(0 + trait | <cluster2 col>)` term then fits a per-trait
#'   variance at this second grouping, exactly as `cluster` does at the
#'   third slot.
#'   Example: `cluster = "site"`, `cluster2 = "year"` to fit
#'   a site variance and a year variance simultaneously. As with the
#'   other slots, nesting is not enforced (crossed and nested both fit).
#'   The cluster2 column must be disjoint from the `unit` / `unit_obs` /
#'   `cluster` columns (a diagonal term routes to whichever slot its grouping
#'   column matches).
#' @param species (deprecated) alias for `cluster`. Kept for
#'   backward compatibility. Use `cluster = ...` in new code.
#' @param family A `family` object. The multivariate engine
#'   (formulas with `latent()`, `indep()`, etc.) supports `gaussian()`,
#'   `binomial()` (logit / probit / cloglog), `poisson()` (log link),
#'   [ordinal_probit()] (the gllvmTMB-native ordinal threshold family
#'   with sigma_d = 1 fixed exactly; no delta-method approximation),
#'   `lognormal()` (log link), `Gamma(link = "log")`,
#'   `nbinom2()` (NB2 negative binomial; log link),
#'   `nbinom1()` (NB1 negative binomial; log link),
#'   `tweedie()` (compound Poisson-Gamma; log link),
#'   `Beta()` (logit link, mean-precision parameterisation; y in (0, 1)),
#'   `betabinomial()` (logit link, mean-precision parameterisation;
#'   k-of-n data),
#'   `student()` (heavy-tailed continuous; identity link),
#'   `truncated_poisson()` (zero-truncated count; log link),
#'   `truncated_nbinom2()` (zero-truncated NB2; log link), and the
#'   hurdle / two-part families `delta_lognormal()` / `delta_gamma()`
#'   (Bernoulli for presence + Lognormal/Gamma for the positive
#'   component; share one linear predictor under the current
#'   implementation -- see Details). For multi-trial binomial or
#'   beta-binomial (k-of-n) data, write the LHS of `formula` as
#'   `cbind(successes, failures)` (the canonical R / `glm()` /
#'   `glmmTMB` convention); the engine then uses the per-row trial
#'   count `successes + failures` as the binomial size. A `weights =`
#'   numeric vector of trial counts is also accepted as an alternative
#'   API (see Details). The negative-binomial families fit one
#'   log-dispersion parameter per trait: `nbinom1()` uses
#'   Var = mu * (1 + phi), while `nbinom2()` uses
#'   Var = mu + mu^2 / phi. The `tweedie()` family
#'   fits one log-phi and one logit-(p-1) per trait, with p in (1, 2).
#'   The `Beta()` and `betabinomial()` families each fit one
#'   log-precision per trait (a = mu*phi, b = (1-mu)*phi; Smithson &
#'   Verkuilen 2006). The `student()` family fits one log-sigma and one
#'   log(df-1) per trait (df > 1; pass `student(df = 3)` to fix df at
#'   a known value). The `truncated_*()` families require strictly
#'   positive integer responses (y >= 1). The delta families fit one
#'   log-dispersion of the *positive* component per trait
#'   (sigma_lognormal or phi_gamma).
#' @param weights Optional numeric vector of length `nrow(data)`. Family-
#'   conditional semantics (lme4 / glmmTMB convention):
#'   * For **non-binomial** families, `weights` is interpreted as per-
#'     observation likelihood multipliers: each row's log-likelihood
#'     contribution is multiplied by `weights[i]`. This matches the
#'     `weights` argument of `lme4::lmer()`, `glmmTMB::glmmTMB()` and
#'     `stats::glm()`. Use this for relative-abundance weighting
#'     (`sqrt(p_si)`), inverse-variance weighting (`1 / var_i` for
#'     heteroscedastic Gaussian fits), or to down-weight outliers.
#'     Must be non-negative and finite; `weights[i] = 0` zeroes that
#'     row's contribution to the joint NLL.
#'     Non-unit likelihood weights define a weighted estimating objective,
#'     not an ordinary maximum-likelihood fit. The package retains point
#'     estimates but refuses likelihood-based model-selection methods;
#'     Hessian/Wald uncertainty is not sandwich-corrected and must not be
#'     interpreted as calibrated inference for the weighted objective.
#'   * For **binomial** families fit without a `cbind(succ, fail)` LHS,
#'     `weights` continues to be interpreted as the per-row trial count
#'     (binomial size; alternative API to `cbind(succ, fail)`). This
#'     pre-existing semantics is preserved on a per-row basis: in mixed-
#'     family fits, binomial rows use `weights[i]` as their trial count
#'     and non-binomial rows use it as the likelihood multiplier.
#'   Default `NULL` is equivalent to a length-`nrow(data)` vector of
#'   ones (unweighted Bernoulli on binomial rows). Wide matrix calls
#'   through [gllvmTMB_wide()] and wide data-frame calls through
#'   [traits()] normalise their accepted weight shapes to this same
#'   stacked response vector before fitting.
#' @param REML Logical; use restricted maximum likelihood for Gaussian-only
#'   fits. The current REML pilot is deliberately narrow: all response rows
#'   must be Gaussian, observation weights are not supported, and `mi()`
#'   predictor models, predictor-informed `latent(..., lv = ~ x)` scores, and
#'   `Xcoef_fixed` maps are not supported. The observed fixed design must be
#'   full rank with positive residual degrees of freedom. Either
#'   missing-response policy may be used: masked cells
#'   (`miss_control(response = "include")`) contribute nothing to the
#'   likelihood, so the restricted likelihood is formed over the observed rows
#'   and matches the corresponding `"drop"` fit. The default `FALSE` keeps the
#'   historical ML fit.
#'
#'   REML is validated for all-Gaussian fits only. For non-Gaussian families
#'   an opt-in escape hatch exists
#'   (`gllvmTMBcontrol(allow_nongaussian_reml = TRUE)`) that realises the
#'   Cox-Reid adjusted profile likelihood rather than an exact restricted
#'   likelihood -- this is unvalidated: a hypothesis under test, not an
#'   inherited result. Users estimating variance components or heritability
#'   on non-Gaussian data should be aware that plain Laplace can carry
#'   substantial downward bias on latent standard deviations. An opt-in AGHQ
#'   engine exists (`gllvmTMBcontrol(aghq = k)`) with its own,
#'   separately-scoped evidence; AGHQ and `REML = TRUE` cannot be combined.
#' @param mesh Optional mesh object from [make_mesh()]. Required for any
#'   `spatial_*()` or `spatial()` term unless that term supplies its own
#'   `mesh =` argument. A supplied mesh with no spatial term is unused:
#'   the fit warns, and a raw fmesher/INLA mesh is rejected, rather than
#'   being silently ignored.
#' @param phylo_tree (legacy global) Optional `ape::phylo` tree. The current
#'   syntax is to pass `tree =` inside
#'   each `phylo_*()` keyword (e.g. `phylo_latent(species, d = K, tree =
#'   tree)`); this argument is the older outer-level fallback and is
#'   slated for soft deprecation. When supplied (in either form) the
#'   `phylo_*()` terms build a sparse \eqn{\mathbf{A}^{-1}} over tips + internal
#'   nodes natively, using only \pkg{ape} and \pkg{Matrix} -- **no
#'   `MCMCglmm` dependency**. The construction is the deterministic
#'   Hadfield & Nakagawa (2010) sparse phylogenetic inverse (appendix
#'   eqs. 26-29), adopted from that method and ported from the sister
#'   package drmTMB (see `inst/COPYRIGHTS`). The result is `~5n`
#'   non-zeros for an `n`-tip tree, vs `n^2` for the dense path. **This is
#'   the recommended path** at any `n_species`; the speedup grows to ~24× at
#'   `n_species = 1000`.
#' @param phylo_vcv (legacy global) Optional tip-only `n_species ×
#'   n_species` phylogenetic correlation matrix. The canonical syntax
#'   is `vcv =` inside each `phylo_*()` keyword. **`r lifecycle::badge("superseded")`**;
#'   prefer `tree =`. The dense path inverts via `Matrix::solve()`,
#'   giving the same MLE as the sparse path but at `O(n^2)` memory and
#'   `O(n^3)` Cholesky cost. Use only when you have a Cphy in hand and
#'   no Newick tree (e.g. comparing against `nlme::corPagel`).
#' @param known_V Optional list of block-diagonal sampling-error matrices
#'   `V_t`. Used by the `equalto()` two-stage workflow when sampling-error
#'   matrices are available from a prior stage of estimation.
#' @param lambda_constraint Optional list with elements `unit` and / or
#'   `unit_obs` (plus `phy`, `spde` for structural levels), each an
#'   `n_traits × d` matrix of confirmatory loading constraints
#'   (galamm-style). `NA` entries are estimated; numerical entries are
#'   pinned. Upper-triangle entries are silently ignored because the engine's
#'   lower-triangular parameterisation already fixes those at zero.
#'   Default `NULL` uses the engine's exploratory lower-triangular
#'   convention. See [confirmatory_lambda()] to build the matrix from
#'   functional-group membership, or [suggest_lambda_constraint()] for a
#'   minimum statistical identification scaffold when you have no
#'   biological hypothesis. Deprecated legacy element names `B` and `W`
#'   are still accepted (with a one-shot soft deprecation message) and
#'   map to `unit` and `unit_obs` respectively.
#' @param Xcoef_fixed Optional named numeric vector of fixed-effect
#'   coefficient constraints. Names must match the expanded fixed-effect
#'   design columns (`fit$X_fix_names`); values must currently be `0`,
#'   pinning those coefficients exactly at structural zero. Use this when a
#'   predictor is meaningful for some responses but should be fixed at zero
#'   for others. Native TMB fits use a parameter map; admitted
#'   `engine = "julia"` fixed-effect-X rows pass the same zero mask to
#'   GLLVM.jl. This is ML-only: `REML = TRUE` stops loudly. Native fitted
#'   objects still report all fixed-effect rows; pinned rows have
#'   `estimate = 0`, `std.error = NA`, and `status = "fixed"` in
#'   `tidy(fit, "fixed")`.
#' @param control Output of `gllvmTMBcontrol()`.
#' @param missing Output of [miss_control()] configuring missing-data
#'   handling. The default `miss_control()` (`response = "drop"`,
#'   `predictor = "fail"`) omits each missing response *cell*: a unit keeps
#'   every trait it does have, so this is not case-wise deletion.
#'   `miss_control(response = "include")` instead keeps those cells and masks
#'   them out of the likelihood, preserving original-row accounting in
#'   `fit$missing_data`; it reaches the same optimum as the default and differs
#'   in which cells [predict_missing()] can return.
#' @param impute Optional specification of the covariate model for a predictor
#'   declared missing with `mi(x)` in `formula`, used only when
#'   `missing = miss_control(predictor = "model")`. Supply a two-sided
#'   predictor-model formula (for Gaussian sugar, e.g. `x ~ z`) or an
#'   [impute_model()] object for an explicit predictor family. The default
#'   `NULL` is appropriate when no `mi()` term is present.
#' @param silent Logical; suppress TMB and gllvmTMB chatter. Default `TRUE`.
#' @param engine Character; `"tmb"` (default) fits with the native TMB engine,
#'   `"julia"` routes the fit through the experimental GLLVM.jl bridge fitting
#'   path via JuliaCall (see `R/julia-bridge.R`). The Julia path currently maps
#'   the unconstrained-ordination core (a single `latent()` block + per-trait
#'   intercepts) and errors on structures it does not yet support.
#' @param ci_method Confidence-interval route requested at fit time for
#'   admitted `engine = "julia"` no-X rows. One of `"none"` (default),
#'   `"wald"`, `"profile"`, or `"bootstrap"`. Native `engine = "tmb"` fits use
#'   [confint()] after fitting; non-default `ci_*` arguments therefore error
#'   unless `engine = "julia"`. Grouped-dispersion rows, per-trait ordinal rows,
#'   response masks, mixed-family vectors, and fixed-effect-X rows remain gated.
#' @param ci_level Nominal confidence level when `ci_method != "none"` on the
#'   Julia bridge.
#' @param ci_nboot Number of parametric bootstrap replicates when
#'   `ci_method = "bootstrap"` on the Julia bridge.
#' @param ci_seed Seed passed to the Julia bootstrap CI route.
#' @param estimator Estimation criterion. `"ml"` (the default) preserves the
#'   ordinary maximum Laplace-likelihood route. `"mspl"` opts into the
#'   experimental maximum softly penalised Laplace-likelihood point estimator
#'   for the currently admitted complete-Bernoulli surface. This means exactly
#'   one ordinary `latent()` block with no free Psi and `d = 1` or `2`, standalone
#'   `spatial_indep()`, or standalone `spatial_latent()` with `d = 1` or `2`;
#'   one common logit, probit, or complementary-log-log link; complete
#'   single-trial responses; a full-rank resolved fixed-effect design;
#'   all-zero offsets; and the native Laplace engine. Unsupported
#'   structures fail before optimisation.
#'   MSPL does not activate automatically after a separation warning and never
#'   changes the default ML fit.
#'
#' @return A `gllvmTMB` object. With no covariance-structure terms in
#'   the formula the result has class `"gllvmTMB"` (single-response
#'   engine); with `latent()` or other covstruct sugar it has class
#'   `c("gllvmTMB_multi", "gllvmTMB")` (multi-trait engine).
#'   S3 methods are registered on the **subclasses**, not on bare
#'   `gllvmTMB`: for a multi-trait fit (`gllvmTMB_multi`), `tidy()`,
#'   `predict()`, `summary()`, `confint()` and `logLik()` are available, and
#'   `AIC()` / `BIC()` dispatch through `logLik()` only when the fitted point is
#'   an unpenalised native-Laplace ML maximum. AGHQ uses a different integration
#'   objective and a loading ridge returns a penalised MAP point, so ordinary
#'   likelihood comparisons do not apply. An MSPL result has leading class
#'   `"gllvmTMB_mspl"`; likelihood comparison, standard errors, intervals,
#'   profiles, and hypothesis-test methods fail closed because this experimental
#'   surface is point estimation only. Trait-level extractors such as
#'   `extract_ICC_site()` and `extract_communality()` are multi-trait only.
#'
#'   `vcov()` and `coef()` are available too; see
#'   [gllvmTMB_multi-vcov]. `coef()` works on any fit; `vcov()` needs the
#'   `sdreport()` and raises the same typed errors [confint()] does when it
#'   is missing or non-finite.
#'
#'   *History, 2026-08-04:* this block used to say `vcov()` dispatched on
#'   `gllvmTMB`, which was **never true of any release**. It and `coef()`
#'   existed only for `gllvmTMB_va`, where they refuse. The wording was
#'   corrected first, then the two methods were added, which is why the
#'   promise now holds.
#'
#' @section Dispersion parameters in the report slot:
#' The fitted object's `$report` carries per-family dispersion quantities on
#' the natural scale, each a vector of length `n_traits` indexed by trait
#' (except `sigma_eps`, a single scalar). Their names follow the engine's
#' internal parameterisation, **not** standard R distribution arguments;
#' several are easy to misread. What each one IS, and how it maps to
#' standard R arguments (`mu = exp(eta)` unless noted):
#'
#' | Family (report name) | What it is | Standard-R conversion |
#' |---|---|---|
#' | gaussian, lognormal (`sigma_eps`) | residual SD / sdlog; **one scalar shared** by all gaussian *and* lognormal traits | `pnorm(y, mean = eta, sd = sigma_eps)`; `plnorm(y, meanlog = eta, sdlog = sigma_eps)` |
#' | Gamma (`phi_gamma`) | the **shape**, not a dispersion | `pgamma(y, shape = phi, scale = mu / phi)`; `CV(y) = 1 / sqrt(phi)` |
#' | nbinom2 (`phi_nbinom2`) | the NB `size` | `pnbinom(y, size = phi, mu = mu)`; `Var(y) = mu + mu^2 / phi` |
#' | nbinom1 (`phi_nbinom1`) | linear overdispersion, `Var(y) = mu * (1 + phi)` | `pnbinom(y, size = mu / phi, mu = mu)`; the size is mean-dependent |
#' | tweedie (`phi_tweedie`, `p_tweedie`) | dispersion and power `p` in (1, 2) | no base-R CDF; `tweedie::ptweedie(y, mu = mu, phi = phi, power = p)` |
#' | Beta (`phi_beta`) | the precision | `pbeta(y, shape1 = mu * phi, shape2 = (1 - mu) * phi)` with `mu = plogis(eta)` |
#' | betabinomial (`phi_betabinom`) | precision of the Beta mixing | `a = mu * phi`, `b = (1 - mu) * phi` with `mu = plogis(eta)`; no base-R CDF |
#' | student (`sigma_student`, `df_student`) | the **scale**, not the SD | `pt((y - eta) / sigma, df)`; `SD(y) = sigma * sqrt(df / (df - 2))`, undefined for `df <= 2` |
#' | truncated_nbinom2 (`phi_truncnb2`) | the NB `size`; a **separate** vector from `phi_nbinom2` | `pnbinom(y, size = phi, mu = mu)` renormalised by `1 - pnbinom(0, ...)` |
#' | delta_lognormal (`sigma_lognormal_delta`) | sdlog of the positive part | `plnorm(y, meanlog = eta, sdlog = sigma)` for `y > 0`; `P(y > 0) = plogis(eta)` |
#' | delta_gamma (`phi_gamma_delta`) | the **CV** of the positive part, not a shape | `pgamma(y, shape = 1 / phi^2, scale = mu * phi^2)` for `y > 0`; `P(y > 0) = plogis(eta)` |

#' This paper is the logistic mixed-effects antecedent for the fixed-effect
#' Jeffreys component. The probit, complementary-log-log, reduced-rank GLLVM,
#' and spatial penalties implemented here are gllvmTMB-specific extensions;
#' that paper does not validate those extensions.
#'
#' @details
#' `gllvmTMB()` parses the glmmTMB-style formula, converts wide
#' [traits()] input to the same internal stacked-trait representation as
#' explicit long data, and dispatches to the underlying TMB template.
#' Covariance-structure terms (`latent()`, `indep()`, `propto()`,
#' `equalto()`, `spatial()`) are processed by extending the formula parser
#' and the TMB template.
#'
#' Per the manuscript, when stacking traits one should set
#' `dispformula = ~ 0` so that no implicit residual variance competes
#' with structured `indep(0 + trait | …)` terms. `gllvmTMB()` enforces
#' this internally.
#'
#' **Multi-trial binomial**. The TMB engine evaluates `dbinom(y, n_trials, p)`
#' so binomial fits are not restricted to Bernoulli (size = 1). To pass a
#' per-row trial count, use either:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `cbind(successes, failures) ~ ...` on the LHS of the formula
#'         (canonical R / `glmmTMB` convention; recommended), or
#'   \item a flat response `y` with `weights = n_trials` (the alternative
#'         glmmTMB API).
#' }
#' Both interfaces produce identical fits. For Bernoulli data, omit
#' `weights` and use a 0/1 response; the engine sets `n_trials = 1` and
#' the likelihood is identical to the previous Bernoulli-only behaviour.
#'
#' **Missing responses and predictors.** `NA` response cells are treated as
#' unobserved unit-trait cells. Under the default
#' `miss_control(response = "drop")`, they are dropped before the TMB likelihood
#' is built; with `miss_control(response = "include")`, they are kept in the
#' model data, masked out of the likelihood, and available through
#' [predict_missing()]. For `cbind(successes, failures)` binomial responses, a
#' row is treated as missing when either response component is missing.
#' Observation weights, when supplied, are subset to retained likelihood rows
#' before validation. Ordinary missing predictors, grouping variables, or
#' fixed-effect design values still error because the model cannot construct a
#' design row; explicitly modelled missing predictors use `mi(x)`,
#' `miss_control(predictor = "model")`, and `impute = list(...)`.
#' The modelled-`mi()` route is native Laplace only; the variational route
#' refuses `mi()` predictors. Dense missing-response masks have their own
#' narrower VA fence and do not imply predictor-model support.
#' These contracts are covered by the package's missing-data validation tests,
#' both for responses and for predictors.
#'
#' **Delta (hurdle) families.** `delta_lognormal()` and `delta_gamma()`
#' use a *single* linear predictor for both components: presence is
#' \eqn{\Pr(y > 0) = \mathrm{invlogit}(\eta)} and the positive-component
#' mean is \eqn{E[y \mid y > 0] = \exp(\eta)}. This matches sdmTMB's
#' standard delta default (one fixed-effects matrix, one set of trait
#' random effects). The shared-predictor scheme is the simplest hurdle
#' formulation; a future release may decouple the two predictors so
#' presence and abundance can have independent fixed and random effects.
#' Only `type = "standard"` (the default) is currently wired in the
#' multivariate engine; `type = "poisson-link"` is not implemented. Each
#' delta family carries one per-trait dispersion of the *positive*
#' component (no extra Bernoulli dispersion). The response must be
#' non-negative.
#'
#' ## Per-trait residual variance: when does it activate?
#'
#' "Residual" in a mixed-effects model is **scale-relative**: what
#' counts as residual variance shifts as you add levels to the model.
#' In a Gaussian fit without a per-row diagonal term, the residual is row-level
#' noise captured by a single shared `sigma_eps`. Once you add a per-row
#' `indep(0 + trait | obs)` term,
#' the *row-level* residual is now T per-trait random-effect variances and
#' `sigma_eps` is auto-suppressed to avoid double-counting. If you also add a
#' site-level diagonal term on top, the row-level term remains the residual and
#' the `site`-level term is now an additional, *higher-level* random effect, not
#' a residual at all. The dispatch table below records this explicitly for the
#' configurations the engine supports today.
#'
#' Gaussian and lognormal responses have one residual scale parameter,
#' `sigma_eps`. Ordinary Gamma responses instead carry a per-trait shape
#' `phi_gamma` (CV = `1 / sqrt(phi_gamma)`). Per-trait residual variances
#' only appear if you explicitly add a per-row `indep(...)` term.
#' The dispatch is automatic:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{No per-row `indep`, Gaussian/lognormal present}{One
#'     shared `sigma_eps` across Gaussian/lognormal rows. *Not* per-trait.}
#'   \item{No per-row `indep`, no Gaussian/lognormal rows}{`sigma_eps`
#'     is mapped off; the family's intrinsic dispersion handles the residual
#'     (for ordinary Gamma, `phi_gamma`).}
#'   \item{\code{indep(0 + trait | g)} where `g` has fewer levels than
#'     rows (e.g. `g = "site"`)}{`sigma_eps` is still estimated as the
#'     row-level residual; the diagonal term adds a per-trait random
#'     effect at level `g` on top.}
#'   \item{\code{indep(0 + trait | obs)} at the per-row level (one
#'     level per row), Gaussian/lognormal rows fitted}{`sigma_eps` is
#'     auto-suppressed (mapped off, fixed at a tiny stabiliser); the
#'     T per-trait diagonal random effects *are* the residual. A
#'     one-shot `cli::cli_inform` fires at fit time announcing the
#'     auto-suppression.}
#'   \item{\code{indep(0 + trait | obs)} at the per-row level,
#'     non-Gaussian or mixed-family fit}{Treated as observation-level
#'     random effects (OLRE). For Bernoulli traits the OLRE is
#'     statistically unidentifiable and is mapped off; for hurdle /
#'     delta families a warning is emitted (see "Per-family-aware OLRE
#'     selection" below).}
#' }
#'
#' Mnemonic: Gaussian/lognormal `sigma_eps` is the default; ordinary Gamma uses
#' `phi_gamma`; per-row `indep` replaces the Gaussian/lognormal scalar residual
#' with T per-trait residuals; non-per-row `indep` adds a higher-level random
#' effect on top of the family residual;
#' non-continuous families never carry `sigma_eps` regardless.
#'
#' **Per-family-aware OLRE selection.** When
#' `indep(0 + trait | <unit_obs>)` is at
#' per-row resolution, i.e. one row per `(trait, unit_obs)` cell, the resulting
#' per-trait random effects on the linear predictor are an observation-level
#' random effect (OLRE). The engine now decides per trait what to do with the
#' OLRE variance based on the trait's response family:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item **single-trial Bernoulli** (`binomial()`, all rows have
#'         `n_trials == 1`): `theta_diag_W[t]` and the corresponding
#'         `s_W` column are mapped off. The OLRE is statistically
#'         unidentifiable here (no within-cell replication) and the MLE
#'         is the trivial boundary \eqn{\sigma_W \to 0}; pinning the
#'         parameter at \eqn{\sigma_W \approx 10^{-6}} removes the
#'         spurious free parameter and emits a one-shot informational
#'         message. Multi-trial binomial (via `cbind(succ, fail)` or
#'         `weights = n_trials`) is identifiable and fit normally.
#'   \item **delta / hurdle families** (`delta_lognormal()`,
#'         `delta_gamma()`): OLRE is fit as before, but a one-shot
#'         warning is emitted because the OLRE acts on the *shared*
#'         linear predictor of the hurdle and mixes presence and
#'         positive-component noise.
#'   \item **all other families**: OLRE is fit as before.

#' @section Objective provenance:
#' A fitted object carries two different surfaces that both look like "the
#' objective", and they answer different questions.
#'
#' `report$joint_nll_unpenalized` and `report$joint_nll_penalized` are
#' **conditional joint** quantities computed on the TMB tape (the negative
#' log-likelihood of the data and random effects at their current values,
#' before and after TMB-side MSPL penalty terms are added). They see only
#' penalties applied *inside* the C++ template -- the LA-MSPL penalties
#' documented above -- and never see anything computed at the R level.
#'
#' `fit$objective_components` is the **marginal** surface: the value TMB's
#' Laplace approximation integrates the random effects out of, decomposed
#' into `likelihood_nll` (the unpenalised marginal negative log-likelihood),
#' `ridge_penalty` (the R-level loading ridge from `aghq_ridge`, added
#' *outside* the TMB objective -- see `.gllvmTMB_penalised_gradient()`),
#' `optimization_nll` (their sum, the objective the optimiser actually
#' minimised), and `optimizer_reported` (the value `nlminb()` / `optim()`
#' returned). This is the **only** place the R-level loading ridge appears;
#' `report$joint_nll_*` cannot see it because it never reaches the TMB tape.
#'
#' The two surfaces are **not expected to match**, on a ridged fit or
#' otherwise, and a difference between them is not itself an error: they are
#' conditional-joint and marginal quantities from different penalty regimes.

  ## Measured, 12,000 fits, binomial p=6 q=2 (docs/dev-log/audits/
  ## 2026-07-31-campaign-stage1-verified.md): under plain defaults the fitted loading
  ## norm exceeds twice the truth in 98-99% of fits at sigma_lambda = 3 across every
  ## n, and 49% at n = 100 even at sigma_lambda = 1. That is the common case, not an
  ## edge case -- and the fit reports `convergence = 0` with a positive-definite
  ## Hessian and no message, so a user has NO signal unless one is given.
  ##
  ## This SURFACES the detection that already exists in
  ## `.gllvmTMB_binomial_prevalence_loading_row()` rather than inventing a second
  ## rule. Deliberately: a new absolute constant here would be another instance of
  ## the #857 scale-dependent-constant class, and the existing thresholds at least
  ## have a link-scale rationale (a logit loading IS the trait's latent SD in link
  ## units, so 6 saturates) and are already documented and tunable via
  ## `gllvmTMB_diagnose()`.
  ##
  ## It WARNS and does not fix. The remedy has a measured failure regime of its
  ## own, and a fix users trust that silently fails is worse than no fix.
  ##
  ## That regime is NARROW, and an earlier version of this comment stated it in a
  ## way that was wrong twice (corrected 2026-08-02). It read: "`aghq_ridge = 2`
  ## still runs away in 67% of fits at n = 1600, sigma_lambda = 3; see #847".
  ##   (a) WRONG ARM. #847's own table gives `laplace_ridge` 67% and `aghq_ridge`
  ##       0% at that cell -- same tau = 2, same DGP, same seeds, opposite
  ##       outcome. The 67% belongs to the ridge on the LAPLACE path.
  ##   (b) NO REGIME. It was quoted as a property of the ridge. It is not.
  ##       Reproduced 2026-08-02 (720 fits, 30 seeds/cell, Totoro) using #847's
  ##       own statistic, median ||Lambda_hat||_F / ||Lambda||_F, "runaway" being
  ##       that ratio > 2:
  ##
  ##         binomial-LOGIT, sigma_lambda = 3, ridge:
  ##           p = 6 : n=100 0.0%/0.671 | n=400 3.3%/1.252 | n=1600 53.3%/2.087
  ##                   (#847: 0%/0.666  |       1%/1.216   |        67%/2.185)
  ##           p = 12: 0% at EVERY n (median ratio 0.708 / 0.896 / 1.081)
  ##         binomial-PROBIT and ordinal-PROBIT, same arm, 3600 fits: 0% at the
  ##           n=1600 / sigma_lambda=3 cell under BOTH that criterion and
  ##           rel_frob > 10 (median ratio 0.959).
  ##
  ##       So the failure needs LOGIT and small p TOGETHER. Outside that corner
  ##       the ridge was strongly protective in every cell measured -- e.g.
  ##       55.2% -> 0.2% runaway at n = 60 on the probit grid. Do not cite the
  ##       67% without its regime, and do not read it as "the ridge is unsafe".

#' Control parameters for [gllvmTMB()]
#'
#' @param d_B,d_W Latent dimensions for the between-unit and within-unit
#'   reduced-rank components. Set to a positive integer to enable
#'   `latent()` / `indep()` covariance structures at the corresponding tier.
#' @param spde_mode `"per_trait"` (default) fits one independent SPDE field
#'   per trait when a `spatial()` term is present; `"shared"` fits one shared
#'   SPDE field with trait-specific scalar loadings.
#' @param n_init Number of random-start replicates. Reduced-rank GLLVMs
#'   are often multimodal because the latent-factor likelihood has many
#'   equivalent local maxima; running several restarts with different
#'   starting values and keeping the fit with the lowest `-logLik`
#'   reduces the risk of settling on a suboptimal solution. Default
#'   1 (single fit). Increase to 5–10 for two-level rr models.
#' @param optimizer One of `"nlminb"` (default) or `"optim"`. Use the
#'   latter together with `optArgs` for finicky two-level rr fits.
#' @param optArgs A list of arguments passed to the optimiser. For
#'   `optim` the most useful is `list(method = "BFGS")`.
#' @param init_jitter Standard deviation of N(0, sigma) jitter applied to
#'   the starting parameter vector across the `n_init` restarts.
#'   Default 0.3.
#' @param init_strategy One of `"default"` (current behaviour) or
#'   `"single_trait_warmup"`. The warmup option fits an intercept-only univariate GLM
#'   per trait, using that trait's family, and seeds the matching
#'   `log_phi_*` entries before `MakeADFun()`. Recommended for count
#'   families (especially `nbinom2`) where the default initialisation
#'   can leave the optimiser walking the
#'   \eqn{(\psi_t, \phi_t)} trade-off ridge. No effect for traits whose
#'   family doesn't carry a `phi` parameter (Gaussian, Poisson, binomial).
#'   Default `"default"`.
#' @param start_method Optional reduced-rank starting-value method, modelled
#'   after `glmmTMB::glmmTMBControl(start_method = ...)` but extended for
#'   two-level gllvmTMB models. Use `list(method = "res", jitter.sd = 0.2)`
#'   to seed `latent()` loadings and latent scores from a reduced-rank
#'   decomposition of fixed-effect residuals. Use `list(method = "indep")`
#'   to first fit the matching independent diagonal GLMM/GLLVM and
#'   copy its estimated fixed effects, per-trait variance starts, and random
#'   effects into the full latent covariance fit. `jitter.sd` adds Normal jitter
#'   to residual-start latent scores. Default
#'   `list(method = NULL, jitter.sd = 0)` keeps the historical starts.
#' @param start_from Optional fitted `gllvmTMB` object, usually a simpler
#'   model such as one `latent()` tier or an independent diagonal model
#'   (`indep()`). Any estimated TMB
#'   parameters with shapes matching the current model are copied into the
#'   starting parameter list before optimisation.
#'   This implements the "fit simpler, then use it as starting values"
#'   workflow recommended for complex reduced-rank models.
#' @param se Logical; if `TRUE`, compute `TMB::sdreport()` after
#'   optimisation so Wald standard errors and Hessian diagnostics are
#'   available. If `FALSE`, skip standard-error calculation and return the
#'   point-estimate fit with `sd_report = NULL` and a diagnostic note. This
#'   is useful for hard models where the point estimate is needed and
#'   uncertainty will be obtained by bootstrap or profile methods. Default
#'   `TRUE`.
#' @param verbose If `TRUE`, prints a one-line summary per restart so
#'   the user can see which seed led to the winning fit. Default
#'   `FALSE`.
#' @param va_H Gauss-Hermite quadrature order for the variational route, a
#'   single odd integer `>= 3` (default `7`). Ignored unless
#'   `integration = "va"`.
#'
#'   Quadrature dominates the cost of a variational fit and the work is linear
#'   in `H`, so this is the main speed control on that route. On a binomial
#'   probit cell with 20 traits, `H = 7` was indistinguishable from `H = 61` in
#'   both the recovered loading scale and the recovered linear predictor, at
#'   two and at five latent dimensions, while running 3.4-6.7 times faster.
#'   `H = 5` was measurably worse at five latent dimensions. Gate E therefore
#'   promoted `H = 7`; `H = 61` remains available as a diagnostic.
#'
#' @param va_eval_method How the variational route evaluates the per-observation
#'   expectation. `"auto"` (default) selects Gauss-Hermite quadrature for every
#'   admitted scalar family/link cell and is what you want unless you are
#'   comparing methods.
#'
#'   `"gh"` uses Gauss-Hermite quadrature. `"jj"` uses the Jaakkola-Jordan
#'   bound, which is defined only for pure binomial-logit fits and is
#'   substantially cheaper. The two differ in more than speed: on binary data
#'   the bound's recovered loading magnitudes are biased downward and do not
#'   improve as the sample grows, whereas quadrature's converge. Latent-variable
#'   *scores*, and therefore ordinations, are effectively unaffected by the
#'   choice. Ignored unless `integration = "va"`.
#'
#' @param integration Which method evaluates the latent-variable integral.
#'   `"laplace"` (default) is the Laplace approximation. For an unpenalised
#'   native-Laplace fit, [logLik()], [AIC()], [BIC()] and likelihood-ratio tests
#'   have their ordinary maximum-likelihood interpretation. AGHQ-refined fits
#'   also expose these methods, but use a different integration objective and
#'   must not be compared across engines; with a loading ridge, the fitted
#'   point is penalised MAP and ordinary likelihood-comparison interpretations
#'   do not apply.
#'
#'   `"va"` selects an opt-in **research** route whose objective is an evidence
#'   lower bound, not a marginal likelihood. Fixed-effect [vcov()] and
#'   [confint()] use profiled-Schur VA-Wald information and are labelled
#'   `calibrated = FALSE`; [getLV()] can return a variational posterior SD,
#'   which is not a frequentist random-effect standard error. No nominal
#'   coverage claim is made. A bound must not be compared across ranks or
#'   models, so it cannot be used for model or rank selection.
#'
#'   It is admitted only inside the Gate-E implementation/light-fit region:
#'   `latent(..., unique = FALSE)`, the 18 scalar family/link cells in the
#'   response-family registry, `d` up to 2, up to 80 responses, at least 100
#'   units, and the native TMB engine. A request
#'   outside that region is an **error**, not a warning. The `d`
#'   limit is retained from the historical explicit-JJ preregistered recovery
#'   gate: `d = 4` was measured and refused because, with few responses, the
#'   planted axes collapsed more often than that gate allowed. This is an
#'   implementation admission fence, not recovery evidence for the current
#'   automatic GH-H7 route. In the current 36-cell family-by-rank campaign only
#'   the Poisson-log `q = 5` cell passed the overall point route, and that rank
#'   lies outside the public `d <= 2` fence; VA therefore remains experimental
#'   and `calibrated = FALSE`.
#'   It cannot be combined with `aghq`, which is an alternative evaluation of
#'   the same integral rather than an additional layer.
#'
#'   Offering this value advertises nothing about its accuracy.
#'
#'   `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")` The **ordination surface is
#'   available** for a `"va"` fit: [extract_ordination()], [getLV()],
#'   [getLoadings()] and [extract_loadings()] return latent scores and
#'   loadings as POINT ESTIMATES. Fixed-effect [confint()] and [vcov()] expose
#'   uncalibrated VA-Wald uncertainty; `getLV(se = TRUE)` returns a variational
#'   *posterior* SD, not a frequentist standard error, and only when
#'   `eval_method` resolves to `"gh"`. Loading/covariance intervals remain
#'   unavailable.
#'
#'   **Historical explicit-JJ evidence.** Recovery of the ordination below was
#'   measured with the earlier JJ evaluator against planted truth at the
#'   admitted cells (`d = 2`, 8 responses, n = 150 and 400, 50 seeds per cell;
#'   `dev/va-usability/A2-ATTENUATION.md`), with the Laplace route run on the
#'   same simulated data as a control. This campaign predates the current
#'   automatic Gauss-Hermite default and must not be used as evidence for the
#'   accuracy of the current GH-default route:
#'
#'   * **Gaussian**: the loading-implied variance is recovered at 0.98–1.02 of
#'     truth, and the mean paired difference in latent-score correlation
#'     against Laplace is below `2e-07` at both `n`.
#'   * **Poisson**: also 0.98–1.02 of truth, with a paired latent-score
#'     difference of ~`4e-04`, negligible in magnitude but statistically
#'     detectable, and the loading scale sits ~1% below Laplace.
#'   * **Binomial**: latent scores recover at about r = 0.59. That ceiling is a limit
#'     of **binary data** at these cells rather than of the historical JJ route:
#'     the Laplace default reaches about r = 0.56–0.59 on the same data, and a third
#'     estimator (Gauss-Hermite) lands in the same place. The loading SCALE,
#'     however, is biased low (0.58–0.67 of truth) and this **is** a real bias
#'     relative to Laplace, whose median brackets 1. Read a binomial
#'     ordination's axes and relative positions, not the absolute magnitude of
#'     its loadings.
#'
#'   The comparison is not effort-matched: the historical JJ arm ran four starts
#'   behind an agreement-and-gradient health gate, the Laplace arm a single
#'   start admitted on a positive-definite Hessian.
#'
#'   `"va"` returns an object of class `"gllvmTMB_va"` (see
#'   [gllvmTMB_va-methods]) rather than an ordinary fit, so that every method
#'   which would treat its objective as a likelihood fails loudly instead of
#'   returning a number. Because the engine runs its own multi-start and
#'   optimiser policy, the search settings of [gllvmTMBcontrol()] (`n_init`,
#'   `optimizer`, `optArgs`, `start_from`, `init_*` and `se`) have no effect
#'   on this route. Any model structure the route cannot represent (a latent
#'   term away from the unit grouping, a constrained ordination, an offset,
#'   weights, `REML`, `lambda_constraint`, `Xcoef_fixed`, or a further random
#'   effect) is an **error**, never a silent omission.
#'
#'   There is no `"eva"` value. The EVA engine exists in this package and is
#'   reachable as a research route, but it is not wired to [gllvmTMB()], and an
#'   argument value that could only ever raise an error would advertise a
#'   capability the package does not have. No general coefficient, covariance,
#'   interval, or calibration claim is made for EVA. Existing measurements are
#'   research diagnostics only and do not establish a public estimator route.
#' @param aghq Adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature for the between-unit latent
#'   block. `FALSE` (default) fits by Laplace approximation. A positive integer
#'   requests that many quadrature nodes. `"auto"` lets the package decide, and
#'   it declines to Laplace whenever the model is ineligible or the expected
#'   gain does not justify the cost. **Opt-in and experimental**: no capability
#'   claim is made for quadrature-fitted models, and eligibility is narrow: the
#'   random part must be a single ordinary `latent()` block on the unit tier.
#' @param aghq_iter_cap Optimiser iteration budget for the first adaptation
#'   pass. Default `1L`. Later passes escalate when continuation is enabled.
#' @param aghq_n_adapt Maximum number of adaptation passes. Default `400L`.
#' @param aghq_ridge Ridge penalty on the loadings, as the scale `tau`;
#'   `Inf` disables it. Default `2`. Naming a numeric value explicitly also
#'   makes the `Laplace + ridge` control reachable without quadrature.
#'   The default does not penalise an ordinary Laplace fit unless the caller
#'   explicitly names `aghq_ridge`. AGHQ itself is opt-in, but once enabled it
#'   uses the default `tau = 2` penalised MAP route unless `Inf` is requested.
#'   `"auto"` is an **opt-in experimental** route for pure single-trial
#'   Bernoulli models with one ordinary unit-tier `latent()` block. It uses an
#'   unpenalised 9-node multi-start AGHQ pilot, then
#'   `tau = min(6, max(1, ||Lambda_pilot||_F / sqrt(pq)))`. If the pilot or
#'   scale-aware final fit is unusable, the returned fit transparently falls
#'   back to the shipped `tau = 2` route; inspect
#'   `fit$aghq$ridge_auto`. Evidence supports failure/runaway avoidance in this
#'   scope, not a broad loading-accuracy improvement. The measured grid used a
#'   logit link with `p = 6`, `q = 2`, and `n = 100`, `400`, or `1600`; other
#'   links and dimensions are extrapolations. The
#'   `"auto"` route always uses 9-node multi-start AGHQ for both pilot and final
#'   fits; a conflicting node/start control is replaced with a warning, while an
#'   explicit `aghq = FALSE` is incompatible.
#' @param loading_ridge Integration-neutral alias for `aghq_ridge`. Use this
#'   spelling to request the same loading MAP penalty on a Laplace fit without
#'   suggesting that the penalty belongs to AGHQ. The default `NULL` preserves
#'   historical unpenalised Laplace fits. Supply at most one of
#'   `loading_ridge` and `aghq_ridge`; neither may be combined with
#'   `estimator = "mspl"`.
#' @param warn_runaway If `TRUE` (default), warn once per session when a
#'   binomial latent-variable fit triggers the package's existing runaway-loading
#'   diagnostic. Set `FALSE` to silence the fit-time warning; the diagnostic
#'   remains available through [gllvmTMB_diagnose()]. The same switch also
#'   governs the multinomial contrast-degeneracy warning (collapsed contrast
#'   variance, rail-correlated contrasts, or a collapsed spatial range), which
#'   uses its own once-per-session slot so neither family's warning can
#'   suppress the other's. Ordinal fits emit no fit-time warning: that row's
#'   arms ship disarmed because no threshold met its calibration targets, so
#'   it reports statistics through [check_gllvmTMB()] only.
#' @param aghq_continuation If `TRUE` (default), the adaptation loop may raise
#'   `aghq_iter_cap` across passes. `FALSE` pins the cap and disables escalation.
#' @param aghq_shift_tol,aghq_grad_tol,aghq_f_tol Convergence tolerances for the
#'   adaptation loop: the quadrature-point shift, the gradient at the adaptation
#'   point, and the change in objective. Defaults `1e-4`, `1e-4`, `1e-9`.
#' @param aghq_grad_tol_rel Relative gradient tolerance, tested as
#'   `max|grad| / max(1, |objective|)`. Default `1e-6`. The gradient of a
#'   likelihood summed over many observations grows with the sample, so the
#'   absolute `aghq_grad_tol` on its own becomes unreachable at scale. The two are
#'   combined with `OR`, so this can only ever admit more fits as converged, never
#'   fewer; set it to `0` to test the absolute tolerance only. Read
#'   `fit$aghq$converged` for the verdict, **not** `fit$opt$convergence`, which
#'   on the quadrature path records the optimiser's per-pass iteration cap and so
#'   reports a limit even on a healthy fit.
#' @param aghq_multistart If `TRUE` (default), the quadrature is run from two
#'   starting points: the Laplace optimum and a data-driven alternative that uses
#'   no knowledge of the truth. The fit with the better final objective is

#' @details
#' **Recommended workflow for two-level latent models.** Reduced-rank
#' likelihoods are notoriously multimodal in two-level fits like
#' `value ~ 0 + trait + latent(0+trait|ID, d_B) + latent(0+trait|obs_ID, d_W)`.
#' The recommended workflow is:
#'
#' 1. Run several restarts (`n_init = 5` to `10`) and keep the one
#'    with the lowest `-logLik`.
#' 2. If that fails to converge cleanly, switch the optimiser to
#'    `optim` with `BFGS`:
#'    `gllvmTMBcontrol(optimizer = "optim", optArgs = list(method = "BFGS"))`.
#' 3. `start_method = list(method = "res", jitter.sd = 0.2)` is
#'    **soft-deprecated as of 0.6.0** and warns once per session. It still
#'    fits: it decomposes the fixed-effect residual matrix into starting
#'    values for \eqn{\Lambda} and the latent scores. Do not reach for it.
#'
#'    It was retired on measurement. Across 89 simulated fits (Gaussian,
#'    Poisson and negative-binomial, `d = 1` to `3`, three and five traits),
#'    it was **never materially better** than the default start (its three
#'    best margins were 0.07, 0.29 and 0.66 log-likelihood units) and was
#'    materially worse eight times, once by 14.6 units. At `d >= 2` it made
#'    no difference at all. Every failure reported `convergence == 0` and a
#'    positive-definite Hessian on both sides, so the worse fit was silent,
#'    and restarts did not detect it: in one such fit all five `n_init = 5`
#'    restarts returned the same worse optimum.
#'
#'    If you use it anyway, compare `fit$opt$objective` against a
#'    default-start fit and keep the lower value.
#' 4. For Gaussian two-level models, prefer
#'    `start_method = list(method = "indep")` or manually fit a simpler
#'    model and pass it through `start_from = simpler_fit`. This is a GLMM
#'    warm start rather than a fixed-effect-only GLM residual start.

#'
#' Configures how [gllvmTMB()] treats missing **responses** and missing

#' [gllvmTMB()].
#'
#' @param response How to treat rows whose response value is `NA`.
#'   `"drop"` (default) omits each missing response *cell* before the
#'   likelihood is built. In long format one row is one `(unit, trait)` cell,
#'   and the wide `traits()` route drops the same cells, so a unit keeps every
#'   trait it does have -- this is cell-wise omission, not case-wise deletion.
#'   `"include"`
#'   keeps those rows, builds an observed-response mask (`is_y_observed`), and
#'   contributes nothing to the likelihood for the masked rows -- the
#'   frequentist observed-data likelihood. For the supported routes, the
#'   observed-response likelihood contribution matches the corresponding
#'   observed rows, while cell identity is preserved for [predict_missing()].
#' @param predictor How to treat missing **predictors** (covariates).
#'   `"fail"` (the default): a missing value in the fixed-effect design matrix
#'   is an error, exactly as today. `"model"` treats a missing predictor
#'   declared with `mi(x)` as a latent variable integrated out by the Laplace
#'   approximation, with its covariate model supplied via the `impute =`
#'   argument of [gllvmTMB()]. The current routes fit one modelled predictor
#'   at a time: Gaussian fixed-effect, grouped-intercept, or phylogenetic-
#'   intercept covariate models, plus fixed-effect binary, ordered, and
#'   unordered discrete predictors.
#' @param engine The estimation engine. The supported value is `"laplace"`
#'   (TMB Laplace
#'   approximation). `"em"` (the Gaussian-only EM special case) and `"profile"`
#'   are **reserved names, not yet supported**.
#'
#' @details
#' There is deliberately **no** `estimator` argument in `miss_control()`:

#' missing-response policy -- including `miss_control(response = "include")`,
#' where the restricted likelihood is formed over the observed rows -- but not
#' yet with `mi()` predictor models. There
#' is **no** MI ("multiple imputation") engine here; multiple imputation is a
#' separate workflow.
#'
#' Under the default `miss_control(response = "drop", predictor = "fail",

#' Walks the formula RHS and reports covariance-structure function calls. The
#' glmmTMB spatial names `exp`, `gau`, `ar1`, `ou`, `cs`, `toep`, and `us` are
#' reported only when they look like covariance terms with a bar argument, not
#' when they are ordinary fixed-effect transformations such as `exp(x)`.
#'
#' @param formula A formula.
#' @return Character vector of term names found.
#' @keywords internal
