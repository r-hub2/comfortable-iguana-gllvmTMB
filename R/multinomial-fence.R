## Multinomial structured-term admission fence (Slice 0 + Slice 1 + Slice 2,
## Design 108/123).
##
## `multinomial()` (family_id 16) is fixed-effects-plus-two-tiers only in this
## release: ordinary shared `latent()` at the unit tier (cross-family
## correlations, with its default auto-Psi companion mapped off for the
## categorical contrast diagonal) and intercept-only `phylo_latent()` (the
## among-category phylogenetic surface, default `unique = FALSE` -- it emits
## NO Psi companion at all; `unique = TRUE` is NOT admitted, since a free
## phylogenetic Psi is deliberately unsupported for multinomial, see
## R/extract-sigma.R). Every other structured / random-effect keyword is
## deferred and must fail loud rather than silently fit an unvalidated
## categorical path.
##
## Slice 1 (2026-08-16): the among-category phylogenetic surface is extended
## from `phylo_latent()` alone to also admit loadings-only (`unique = FALSE`)
## `animal_latent()` (pedigree/known-relatedness `A`) and SINGLE-NAME
## loadings-only `kernel_latent()` (a dense supplied `K`). Both are PURE
## ENGINE SUGAR: they desugar (R/brms-sugar.R) into the identical `phylo_rr`
## covstruct `phylo_latent()` itself produces, so no engine/C++ code changes
## for this slice -- only the classifier below and the evidence in
## `tests/testthat/test-matrix-multinomial-phylo.R`. `unique = TRUE` on
## either keyword, their augmented-slope forms, every other animal_*/kernel_*
## mode (`*_indep`/`*_dep`/`*_scalar`/`kernel_unique`), and more than one
## `kernel_latent()` name in the same fit (multi-kernel) remain BLOCKED --
## see the admission table and `.mn_classify_covstruct()` below.
##
## Slice 2 (2026-08-16): the PHYLO MODE AXIS and its animal/kernel twins join
## the admitted set -- `phylo_dep()`/`animal_dep()`/`kernel_dep()` (the
## intercept-only full-`V` route) and `phylo_indep()`/`animal_indep()`/
## `kernel_indep()` plus their soft-deprecated standalone `*_unique()`
## aliases (the diagonal-`V` route). All six/eight resolve to the SAME
## `phylo_rr`/`theta_rr_phy` engine slot as `phylo_latent()` -- `*_dep()`
## with a full free packed-triangular Lambda (IDENTICAL parameterisation to
## `phylo_latent(d = n_traits)`, not merely V-equivalent: both go through
## `gll_unpack_rr_loadings()` with an unconstrained diagonal; the genuinely
## exp()-positive Cholesky diagonal belongs to the AUGMENTED `*_dep(1 + x |
## ...)` slope engine, `theta_dep_chol`, a different covstruct kind that
## stays blocked), `*_indep()`/`*_unique()` with the strict lower triangle
## pinned to 0 via a TMB map (D independent per-contrast variances, no
## among-category correlation). `*_scalar()` (`phylo_scalar()`,
## `animal_scalar()`, `kernel_scalar()`) STAYS REFUSED -- the first two route
## through the unrelated `propto` engine (blocked by the late `use_propto`
## re-scan, unchanged since Slice 0); `kernel_scalar()` shares the SAME
## `.phylo_unique`/`.indep` markers as the now-admitted `kernel_indep()` and
## is distinguished only by `.kernel_mode == "scalar"`, so this file's
## classifier carries an explicit carve-out for it. See
## `dev/multinomial-structured/probe-scalar-null.R` for the null-DGP evidence
## behind the scalar refusal. Augmented (intercept + slope) `*_dep`/`*_indep`
## forms, `*_latent(unique = TRUE)`, and every other cell remain BLOCKED.
##
## Historically the ONLY gate was a late allow-list re-scan of `use_*` engine
## flags in R/fit-multi.R (the "FAIL-CLOSED allow-list", Rose review
## 2026-07-18). That scan is necessary but not sufficient: several keywords
## desugar (R/brms-sugar.R) onto the SAME engine flag as an admitted keyword,
## so the flag-level scan cannot tell them apart and lets them through:
##   * `dep(0 + trait | unit)`            -> same `use_rr_B` flag as `latent()`
##   * `phylo_dep()` / `phylo_indep()` /
##     `phylo_unique()` (standalone)      -> same `use_phylo_rr` flag as
##                                            `phylo_latent()` (phylo_indep and
##                                            phylo_unique are REROUTED onto the
##                                            phylo_rr slot; see fit-multi.R's
##                                            `is_phylo_unique` rerouting block)
##   * single-name `kernel_*()`           -> also `use_phylo_rr` (Design 65 C1
##                                            reuses the phylo_rr engine path)
##   * `animal_latent()`                  -> also `use_phylo_rr`: `animal_*` is
##                                            PURE SUGAR for `phylo_*` (no
##                                            distinguishing marker survives
##                                            the desugar for any OTHER
##                                            `animal_*` keyword either, but
##                                            every other one lands on an
##                                            already-blocked cell; only
##                                            `animal_latent` collides with the
##                                            one ADMITTED cell -- see the
##                                            `.animal_source` marker this file
##                                            adds in R/brms-sugar.R)
##   * `phylo_scalar()` / `animal_scalar()` -> `use_propto`, which was
##                                              EXEMPTED from the scan entirely
##                                              (a non-tier keyword-mapping
##                                              flag alongside `use_equalto`)
##
## This file adds an EARLY covstruct-keyed classifier that reads the raw
## parser markers (`cs$kind`, `cs$extra$.dep`, `$.phylo_unique`,
## `$.kernel_name`, `$.animal_source`, `$.auto_unique`, and the grouping
## column) DIRECTLY off `parsed$covstructs`, before any of that flag-level
## folding happens, so keywords that fold onto the same engine flag are still
## told apart. It is deliberately a fail-closed ALLOW-list: only the current
## admitted set matches; every other covstruct classification aborts.
##
## The late `use_*` re-scan in R/fit-multi.R stays as belt-and-braces (moved
## after every `use_*` flag is defined, including the `use_mi_*` mi()
## predictor flags -- see the call site) and the `use_propto` exemption is
## removed there for family_id 16 fits. Both passes share the classed
## condition "gllvmTMB_multinomial_structured_not_admitted".
##
## Slice-0 repair (adversarial Opus review, 2026-08-16): the FIRST pass of
## this fence, above, had three more holes of the same shape --
## classification gaps that made pass 1 non-load-bearing (a coincidental
## OTHER gate, or the untyped pass-2 scan, happened to catch them instead):
##   * augmented (intercept + slope) ordinary `latent(1 + x | unit)` stays
##     `kind == "rr"` at the unit tier with no `.dep` marker, so the plain
##     unit-tier check admitted it; only untyped pass-2 (`use_rr_B_slope`)
##     caught it.
##   * augmented `phylo_latent(1 + x | species)` stays `kind == "phylo_rr"`
##     with none of the other markers set, so the plain-latent fall-through
##     admitted it; NEITHER pass caught it -- an unrelated per-family
##     augmented-slope-support gate happened to abort first.
##   * `phylo_latent(unique = TRUE)`'s auto-emitted Psi companion
##     (`.phylo_unique` + `.auto_unique`) was classified ADMITTED, directly
##     contradicting R/extract-sigma.R's documented policy that a free
##     phylogenetic Psi is not admitted for multinomial (pass 2 already
##     caught it via `use_phylo_diag`, so this was a documentation/pass-1
##     contradiction, not a live leak).
## Also closed: `equalto()` / `meta_V()` (known-sampling-covariance) was
## blanket-exempted in both passes; it is now fail-closed for fid 16 (no
## established route on a categorical-contrast pseudo-trait).
##
## Slice 4 (Design 123, 2026-08-16): ordinary GROUP random intercepts join
## the admitted set -- a generic `(1 | g)` random intercept (engine kind
## `re_int`, src/gllvmTMB.cpp's `re_int` block) and the non-phylogenetic
## `cluster`/`cluster2` diagonal tier (`indep(0 + trait | g)` via the
## `cluster =`/`cluster2 =` arguments, the `use_diag_species`/
## `use_diag_cluster2` engine slots). Both routes are pre-existing,
## family-agnostic engine code; nothing in src/gllvmTMB.cpp changes for this
## slice -- only the classifier below, a new whole-fit OLRE guard, and their
## test/doc coverage.
##   * `(1 | g)`: `src/gllvmTMB.cpp`'s `re_int` block adds ONE draw per group
##     level to EVERY row of `eta` that shares that group (`re_int_group_id`
##     is read off the group column of the AFTER-expansion pseudo-trait data,
##     R/fit-multi.R, so all K-1 baseline-contrast rows of one multinomial
##     observation carry the SAME group id and so get the SAME draw added).
##     Verified: this shared additive shift does NOT cancel in the softmax
##     between the baseline and any non-baseline category (it moves
##     baseline-vs-rest probability, i.e. P(y = baseline) vs
##     P(y != baseline)); the *ratio* between any TWO non-baseline
##     categories, WITHIN one fit, IS invariant to it (it cancels there).
##     So the semantics are a baseline-vs-rest group effect, and
##     `sigma_re`'s substantive interpretation is
##     REFERENCE-CATEGORY-SPECIFIC. CORRECTION (this task, caught by a test
##     failure -- see the after-task report): re-anchoring the baseline is
##     NOT a reparameterisation of the same model here, so it is not just
##     `sigma_re` that changes -- the fitted response-scale probabilities
##     change too. Under `baseline = 1`, `eta = (0, b0_2 + u_g, b0_3 +
##     u_g)` constrains the log-odds BETWEEN categories 2 and 3 to be
##     constant across groups (`eta_3 - eta_2 = b0_3 - b0_2`, no `u_g`
##     term); under `baseline = 3`, the SAME engine instead shares a (new)
##     `u_g` between categories 1 and 2, constraining THEIR log-odds to be
##     constant instead. These are two different parametric restrictions on
##     the model space, not one distribution under two labels -- unlike the
##     fixed-effects-only case, where relabelling genuinely is a
##     reparameterisation (`test-multinomial.R`'s existing baseline-
##     invariance tests). See `multinomial()`'s roxygen (R/families.R),
##     `test-matrix-multinomial-unit.R`'s Cell (c) (the corrected,
##     within-fit claim), and the informational note `fit-multi.R` emits
##     once per session (`gllvmTMB-multinomial-reint-baseline-inform`).
##   * cluster/cluster2 `indep(0 + trait | g)`: `use_diag_species` /
##     `use_diag_cluster2` are the IDENTICAL engine route (same per-trait
##     independent-normal math, `eta(o) += q_sp(t, species_id(o))` /
##     `eta(o) += r_c2(t, cluster2_id(o))`, src/gllvmTMB.cpp) on two
##     different grouping columns -- so both are admitted together, giving
##     D independent per-CONTRAST (pseudo-trait) variances at that grouping,
##     the per-category random intercept users usually want. The
##     soft-deprecated standalone `unique()` alias is the SAME engine path
##     as `indep()` at this tier too (only the printed label differs, exactly
##     as at the unit tier) and is admitted alongside it.
##     `common = TRUE` (the `scalar()` modifier) STAYS BLOCKED at this tier:
##     the generic engine has no `common`-pooling map for `use_diag_species`/
##     `use_diag_cluster2` (unlike the unit/unit_obs `diag_B_common`/
##     `diag_W_common` map tricks), so a `common = TRUE` request would
##     otherwise be silently admitted and silently ignored rather than
##     actually pooling to one shared level -- refused explicitly instead.
##   * `unit_obs` (`site_species`) grouping stays BLOCKED (no change this
##     slice); augmented slopes and `latent()`/`dep()` at the cluster/
##     cluster2 tiers stay BLOCKED (no engine slot); the spatial mode axis
##     (Slice 3, not this slice) stays BLOCKED.
##   * OLRE guard: for a fid-16 fit, if EVERY level of an admitted `(1 | g)`
##     or cluster/cluster2 `indep()` grouping factor covers exactly one
##     multinomial observation (`.multinom_group_`), the term is an
##     observation-level random effect (OLRE) in disguise -- the softmax
##     latent scale is fixed (no free residual-dispersion parameter, unlike
##     a Gaussian/count response), so a per-observation intercept shared
##     across its own K-1 contrast rows is not identifiable from the fixed
##     effects. `.multinomial_reint_group_olre_guard()` below aborts this
##     case typed, separately from (after) the admission classification --
##     the term IS admitted per-covstruct, exactly like the multi-kernel
##     override is a separate whole-fit check layered on top of an
##     individually-admitted classification.

## The current admitted set. Kept as an explicit constant so the CURRENT
## ADMITTED SET is legible in one place and the cli_abort message below can
## quote it without hand-duplicating prose. `since` records the design/PR
## that admitted the cell; it is documentation only.
## Each row is deliberately ONE classifiable cell with ONE representative
## covstruct shape, so a table-consistency test can iterate every row,
## construct that row's representative covstruct, and assert
## `.mn_classify_covstruct()`'s verdict matches `status` -- catching exactly
## the kind of table/code drift that let row 4 (below) go stale.

#' OLRE guard for `(1 | group)` / cluster / cluster2 group intercepts on a
#' multinomial trait
#'
#' A generic `(1 | g)` random intercept and the `cluster`/`cluster2`
#' `indep()`/`unique()` diagonal tier are admitted (Slice 4, Design 123) as a
#' family-agnostic, per-covstruct classification -- see
#' `.mn_classify_covstruct()` above. But when EVERY level of the grouping
#' factor covers exactly one multinomial observation (one row of the
#' `.multinom_group_` carrier `expand_multinomial_response()` writes), the
#' term is an observation-level random effect (OLRE) in disguise: the
#' softmax latent scale is fixed (no free residual-dispersion parameter,
#' unlike a Gaussian/count response), so a per-observation intercept shared
#' across that observation's own K-1 contrast rows is not identifiable from
#' the fixed effects alone. This is a WHOLE-FIT check against `data` (it
#' needs the observation-to-group mapping, not just the covstruct shape), so
#' it runs as a separate pass after `.multinomial_structured_admission()`,
#' mirroring how the multi-kernel override sits on top of an individually-
#' admitted classification.
#'
#' @param covstructs `parsed$covstructs`.
#' @param data The (already multinomial-expanded) model data frame; must
#'   carry `.multinom_group_` when any fid-16 row is present (always true
#'   once `expand_multinomial_response()` has run).
#' @param family_id_vec Integer family-id vector, one per row of `data`.
#' @param site,ss_name,species,cluster2_col Grouping-tier column names, as in
#'   `.multinomial_structured_admission()`.
#' @return `invisible(NULL)`; called for its `cli_abort()` side effect.
