## Translation layer: the formula/data API -> the variational (VA-R3) engine.
##
## `gllvmTMB(control = gllvmTMBcontrol(integration = "va"))` is an opt-in
## research route. This file is the ONLY connection between the package's
## formula API and `.approximation_engine_fit()`. It is R-side only: Design 72
## s7 keeps TMB / likelihood changes with the maintainer and Codex, never here.
##
## The governing property is NO SILENT FALLBACK. Every path below either
## returns a variational fit or aborts. None returns a Laplace fit, and none
## quietly drops model structure the engine cannot represent -- a dropped
## phylo / spatial / random-intercept term would still report a healthy status
## while fitting a different model than the one the user wrote.


## Which covstruct is the ordinary latent (low-rank) term the engine fits?

## `latent()` is desugared to `rr()` before the parser sees it (R/brms-sugar.R).
## Two other things also produce `kind == "rr"` and are NOT what the engine's
## scalar-`q` signature represents:
##   * `.dep = TRUE` -- dep() / animal_dep(): a FULL-RANK unstructured Cholesky
##     with `d` resolved to n_traits, not a low-rank factor model.
##   * `.latent_augmented = TRUE` -- latent(1 + x | g): the B-tier
##     reaction-norm engine, whose loadings are over the augmented
##     (intercept, slope) x trait vector rather than the intercept-only Lambda.

  ## CURRENT (Design 110 Gate E, 2026-08-06): public `auto` selects GH for every
  ## admitted scalar family/link cell. Explicit JJ remains available only for
  ## pure binomial-logit comparisons. The Gate-3 narrative immediately below
  ## records the superseded historical reason for the old JJ default.
  ## SETTLED by Gate 3 (2026-07-31), maintainer decision the same day. This was
  ## provisionally "gh" while the campaign ran; the campaign chose "jj".
  ##
  ## Under the paired-exclusion rule, va_jj passes the RMSE criterion in EVERY
  ## cell of the design (50/50; 54/54 raw), with a worst-case gap of 0.0393
  ## against a 0.05 tolerance. Ignoring the Laplace comparator entirely, it has
  ## the lower Sigma_B error in 52 of 54 cells (sign test p = 1.7e-13), and that
  ## holds in all eleven leave-one-out subsets over truth, q, p and n -- it is
  ## not carried by any single factor. va_gh passes 13/50, and 26 of its 35
  ## apparent raw-rule passes rest on a Laplace comparator that was itself
  ## degenerate.
  ##
  ## Still named EXPLICITLY rather than inherited from `default_tier` (which is
  ## also "jj", R/va-r3-proto.R): the choice is evidence, so it should be
  ## visible here and on the fit, not implied by a default that could move.
  ##
  ## Binomial only. The Jaakkola-Jordan bound is defined for the logistic term
  ## and nothing else -- poisson-log implements the single tier "gh", where the
  ## expectation is EXACT in closed form, so there is no estimator choice to
  ## make and no Gate 3 evidence to carry (the campaign was Bernoulli). Asking
  ## for "jj" there would simply error. "auto" resolves through the family
  ## registry, which is the right behaviour when the family admits one tier.
  ## Pure binomial keeps JJ (Gate 3); any mixed or non-binomial admitted set
  ## uses GH (Design 108 Stage 2). Named explicitly — "auto" would also resolve
  ## to GH for non-binomial registry entries, but mixed has no single registry
  ## default_tier, so the route pins "gh" rather than relying on that path.
  ## The routing above is what `va_eval_method = "auto"` resolves to, and "auto"
  ## is the default -- so this block is byte-equivalent to the previous hard-wire
  ## for every caller who does not opt out. A caller may now name the tier
  ## explicitly via `gllvmTMBcontrol(va_eval_method = )`; the engine
  ## (`.approximation_engine_va_r3_fit`) validates the family/tier pairing and
  ## refuses "jj" outside pure binomial-logit, so an impossible request errors
  ## there with a family-specific message rather than being silently re-routed.
  ##
  ## HISTORICAL REASON FOR THE OPT-OUT. The old "auto" sent pure
  ## binomial-logit to "jj" (Gate 3,
  ## 2026-07-31, chosen on Sigma_B RMSE). But `jj`'s recovered loading scale is
  ## asymptotically biased -- trace 0.777/0.600/0.538/0.535 at n = 150...2000,
  ## a plateau, not a small-sample effect -- while `gh` converges (1.583 ->
  ## 1.132 -> 1.014). A user who needs loading MAGNITUDES rather than an
  ## ordination had no way to ask for the convergent route. Now they do.

  ## multi-start and optimiser policy, so `gllvmTMBcontrol()`'s search settings
  ## -- n_init, optimizer, optArgs, start_from, init_*, se -- do not reach it
  ## and have no effect on this route. They are search settings, not model
  ## structure: unlike the refusals above, ignoring them cannot change WHICH
  ## model is fitted, only how it is searched for. They are therefore accepted
  ## silently rather than made errors, which would break callers who set a
  ## house-standard control object and switch routes. Documented in
  ## ?gllvmTMBcontrol under `integration`.
